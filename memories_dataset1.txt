Memory A:
Last Friday my wife and I took our 4 year old son to the movie theater. It was the first time he has ever been to the theater. We had 2 free movie passes to use so we only had to pay for one person. We also had a $5 coupon for the concession stand. We let him pick out whatever he wanted from the concession stand and he chose swedish fish. He ate all of the candy before the previews were over. We watched the movie and he talked intermittently throughout but the theater was pretty empty so we didn't disturb anyone. He was thankful afterwards and wanted to watch it again immediately.


Memory B:
It reminds me of when my wife and I (before we were married) used to go to the dollar movie theater when we were in college. It was a second run theater and we didn't have much money so it was all we could afford. We used to go a couple of times per month. One time when we went it was in near-blizzard conditions and we were the only people in the entire theater. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:

Memory B:
Many years ago, I lived in [CITY, US STATE]. I had a great life there and went to many live music concerts. I'm remembering one concert in particular that I spent with some friends of mine. We saw a new band (at that time) called Old Crow Medicine Show perform and had some delicious tacos. It was great fun and we all enjoyed the show and the food.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
There is fairly little that makes the two memories similar aside from them being positive experiences and both involved food. They are different in that memory A involved just me and my family while memory B involved me and my friends. Memory A involved leaving my home and driving a distance while memory B involved an event near my home.

Memory B:
Recalling the time I found out it can be the one closest to you that hurt you the most. Learning that a close friend and family member did something to betray me had me disappointed and not trusting. It was a learning experience and all things happen for a reason.

Memory A:
I got the opportunity to play my drums for the first time in a long, long time. It is difficult for me to be able to play then due to the noise factor and the fact that I live in an apartment. I remember I took an obscene amount of time tuning each drum, packing them up, loading them in my car, driving to the location, unloading and setting them up again. And once I was done playing I had to do it all in reverse again (minus the tuning). Now, I have been able to play my drums in my apartment, but with them effectively neutered soundwise; using mesh drum heads and low volume practice cymbals that dampen the sound sufficiently. But since this opportunity was the first time in a while for me to play them at their normal volume, I almost forgot how loud drums can be and the sound was actually piercing to my ears. I had to get used to it again but once I did I had a good time. 


Memory B:
It reminds me of when I first started playing the drums. When I had to convince my parents I could play by setting up household items in the arrangement of a drum set and playing them a song to convince them to buy me a real drum set. I remember the dull thuds and clanks from hitting cardboard boxes and paint buckets but trying to make it sound musical. I remember hating those sounds but still having an amazing amount of fun playing my makeshift drum set.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Because they both involve the same musical instrument. First time playing in a while vs first time playing makeshift version. They both required a tremendous (to me) amount of time to set up and get right. Both are happy memories.

Last Saturday I played in my first organized Rugby game. I recently joined a team. The game was played on a nice field, just outside of the city. It was quite an event. A lot of fun, even though I'm really just a beginner and still have a ton of stuff to learn. 


Memory B:
The other night we went to try a well-regarded 'tasting menu' at an Indian restaurant in my city. Though it was pretty expensive, the food was amazing. The entire meal was an impressive production. I had a lot of fun and would certainly do it again at some point in the future.

A family gathering took place at my parent's house last week. The event was memorable and fun as I got the chance to see most of my cousins, uncles, aunts that I had not seen for quite some time. We had good conversations about our past lives and how quick we all grew up. It made me feel much more connected to my family.


Memory B:
I recall an event that happened around when I was about 12 years old. I was quite a shy and fragile child during my early teens so words usually got to me. I remember one of my aunts bluntly telling me I wouldn't amount to anything good in the future. The memory has always stuck with me from then till now.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:

I was walking in a state park in the mountains of [CITY, US STATE]. Along both sides of the trails I walked were lush green woods with dotted vines that made it seem almost tropical for such an area. My mind rested it chaotic thoughts and I could breath for the first time in a long time. Id been quite some time since I just enjoyed the simple pleasures of nature, the sounds of birds echoing in the lush woods, the russell if leaves as the wind traveled in patches near and far, and the lush kaleidoscope of green and russet hues of majestic trees that filled my vision. It wasn't so long ago, but I yearn to go there again right now.

As I'm cleaning though I'm just feeling more warn and wishing that my guest would have rented a hotel room instead of having their stay here. It takes me hours to clean and straiten up, and as I do, I hope that this visit won't be long.

Memory A:
I was at work, doing a boring and highly repetitive task; three of my co-workers were present doing the same, or a similar, task. Because what we were doing was not very interesting, and was easy to do without paying very much attention, we were all talking to each other at the same time. Somehow (I don't really remember how), something one of us mentioned touched on the subject of church architecture in the local area. This proved to be a topic of some interest to me and one of my co-workers, and it ended up expanding into a detailed discussion of the series of schisms that separated the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Ancient Assyrian churches from each other, and the later reunions that resulted in the creation of the Eastern Catholic churches. This then got sidetracked into a discussion of Assyrian missionary throughout Central Asia and the resulting influence on ancient Turkic cultures and the Mongols prior to the rise of Genghis Khan (I provided this information from a book I had read recently), as well as the resulting influence of the Syriac alphabet on the creation of the Mongol alphabet, and, ultimately, on Mongol expansion (at the time of Genghis Khan) in the Middle East, specifically the area that is now Iraq and Syria. My co-worker and I got so interested in this matter, and swapping what information we knew about it, that we not only started to lag behind in our work, but completely forgot that our other two co-workers were present, and they became annoyed because they had absolutely no idea what we were talking about.


Memory B:
One time (I cannot remember exactly when, but around several months ago), I had to perform the same task at work that I referred to in the first story. This previous time, I had to do it while by myself (however, I only had to do the same amount of work as I did in the first story--that is, I didn't have to do the work that, in the first story, my co-workers did; rather, we just happened to each be doing our work at different times). Because the work was so boring, it was difficult to focus on it, but there was nothing else to do. Despite mentioning in the first story that my co-worker and I started to lag behind as the conversation grew animated, overall we completed our work much faster than usual. But the time I had to do it by myself, it took much longer than usual, to the extent that I noticed it even at the time. In particular, I remember that I kept drinking large amounts of water and then needing to go to the bathroom excessively frequently, and I suspected even at the time that this was some sort of stupid anxiety reaction in a subconscious attempt to break up the monotony.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Even though the underlying 'story' behind each memory is the same (in both I was at work, performing the same task), they were completely different in terms of how much I enjoyed the situation and, probably as a result, how well/quickly I completed the task.

Memory B:
One day i got a letter with job opportunity in it. Passed HR screening, phone screening and was invited to the on site interview. Everything went great and i got the job offer. The compensation and benefits were much higher than i had with my employer. I was almost ready to take the offer, but my employer decided i was too valuable for the company, so he matched the offer. I didn't expect this to happen. I decided to stay and i don't regret it.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories include me and some kind of decision. But i guess that's the only similarity.  In memory A the decision wan't that serious, we just decided to go.

My husband and I finally got around to grooming our dog. We had put it off for too long. It took us over two hours to trim all of his fur. We used the proper tools and knew what we were doing, but it still took that long. Our dog wanted nothing to do with it, and that's why it took that long.


Memory B:
That memory makes me think back to when we brought our dog home. He is our second dog, and the decision was not made lightly. I knew he would be ""high maintenance"" when I first laid eyes on a photo of him. He was just a tiny ball of fuzz. I'm so glad we brought him home. I love that dog so much.

I remember when I had a heart attack. It was the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, and I've had my fair share of health problems previously. It was about 3AM, I was trying to go to sleep but it was like a bomb went off in my chest. I tried sitting up, because this apparently had been coming on the last three or four days and sitting up helped in the past. I went to another room and to sit and see if it got better, and I suddenly broke out in a cold sweat - like literally I was dry one second and the next I was covered in cold moisture - that's when I really knew something was wrong. I tried getting up to let my Mom know I needed help (I care for my elderly Mother). I almost lost control of my body and slammed into a wall. I luckily made it to her room and only got out that I needed to get to the hospital. I was in so much pain I couldn't think to call 911 and my Mom actually drove me there because she has trouble thinking clearly in stressful situations. We drove up to the emergency room and I staggered out of the car and I heard my Mom say, ""Help my daughter - she's having a heart attack"" and I was thinking, ""No, I don't think so."" Two attendants took me in a wheelchair and hooked me up to an EKG. They were fairly relaxed as they did this. After a moment of review the machine they suddenly spun me around and there were like 20 people surrounding me. That's when I knew it was serious. After that it was getting me ready for surgery and going through the procedure. All-in-all it was a pretty crazy night for someone in their thirties.

Memory A:
I have an autoimmune disorder, and it affects my blood. I am prone to blood loss from the smallest cut, wound or anything and high temperatures affect that also. A little over 10 days ago I started having severe nose bleeds that would not stop. I was very frightened, and on a free afternoon for my husband my nose started again but my husband decided to leave me and attend his church services. I did not appreciate being left alone, he could have stayed with me that day, since he goes to church 3 times a week, I figured he would be OK missing one day.


Memory B:
The memory that the situation with my husband brought on was something very traumatic that happened to me a while ago. It has to do with my illness also. I was at the doctor's office getting a treatment, an infusion, in which a catheter is placed in the vein and medication flows into your vein. This takes 4-5 hours but I experienced a weird feeling. I saw my body but I was not there, I could tell what was happening but could not speak, I saw my husband and the nurses and heard the nurses say I had no pulse and no blood pressure. It was very frightening. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Because when I thought about A, it reminded me of my illness. It naturally progressed into an even worse memory having to do with my illness as well which was memory B. Maybe I am traumatized by my health so it just all flowed together?

A week ago my daughter burned her foot badly in our back yard.  We had been burning tree limbs on Saturday and on Sunday the burn pile was still hot.  My son, her twin brother, taunted her with an invisible booger and she took off into the yard, running straight into the pile of hot ashes.  She ran into the house screaming and we had to act quickly to get her treated as fast as possible.  She ended up with second degree burns on the bottom of her foot and is still currently on crutches while it heals.


Memory B:
My 7 year old son was playing in a baseball game and he was on base, running from first to second.  He broke down to slide and just as he did the second baseman walked into the base path and collided with my son.  I heard the pop of his leg breaking from the stands and knew immediately that something bad happened.  I ran out onto the field and sure enough, he had broken both bones in his lower leg.  It took 6 months of casts, boots and physical therapy to get him healed and back playing again.

I talked to my sister on the phone for the first time in about six months. It was really weird because she seemed like a completely different person. We hadn't been speaking because of an argument and how awful her life had become. Now she is on anti anxiety meds and she was acting really strange and the whole conversation has been continually on my mind.

I was also having trouble making decisions and remembering things, and talking slower than normal.  They gave me an EKG, hooked me up to some monitors, and stuck an IV port in to take blood, in case I needed something else.  The EKG turned out fine, but I ended up diagnosed with shingles and low blood sodium, which can be life threatening, so they administered a bag of IV saline before I left.  I got a couple prescriptions before I left, and I can't tell you what a relief it was to finally find out what the problem was!


Memory B:
Years ago, I started suffering from severe pain in my lower left side one day.  It was bad enough I decided to go to the ER.

I dug a little further into these emails, and after deciding they were legitimate, contacted my landlord. He told me that he had hired a company to manage his properties. This will make things like paying rent and requesting maintenance a much easier process, but will make the legal side of things much harder, considering he was a very easy going guy, and now there is a professional business in charge of things.

When we contacted him he told us not to worry about it, but after a month or so we opted to move out.

The roar of the waterfall in my right ear was deafening. It was only twenty feet away, but its tug on my kayak was surprisingly gentle. Regardless, I beached aggressively. The gravel stifled the kayak's momentum and let me roll forward out of my seat onto the top of my kayak and then step off. The ground was muddy. I pulled the kayak another foot up the bank and then headed along the shoreline, weaving between trees, to the waterfall's edge. It was incredibly loud now and the air was cool and moist. I held my breath for a second, listening, watching, remembering.

Instead of perservering and learning how to do it right, I threw a conniption, blaming my mom and telling her she was a bad teacher and it was her fault.

 I was cleaning my phone case, but had decided to leave at the last minute and needed to take my phone. So I decided to just slip my phone in my purse sans case, and it would be fine (in small cross body).  I have no idea why, but it decided to not slide in, and to fall very gently onto the floor from not a very great distance. And the screen shattered creating actual shards of screen, not a simple crack.  So I sighed and laughed because I had just bought a new battery for it less than 2 months ago in order to avoid buying a new phone. So I collected a sandwich bag, placed it gently in the bag, and detoured to the store to buy a new phone before going on with my day.

I was on my way home from a job I really did not like. I was working two part time jobs and going to school and doing research full-time, so I had a lot of moving pieces in my life. I stepped off the bus in the dark, after staying at work past 7:30pm, irritated because the late hour could have been avoided with proper planning from the top of the organization.  I needed to walk for under 5 minutes, up a street and around the corner. I took my phone (in a case) out of my pocket because it was pitch black. I am still unsure how it happened--possibly because I had 3 bags I was carrying--but I dropped the phone and when I picked it up the screen was cracked. I laughed because it was the icing on the day, and meant that my fantasies of quitting would be put on hold since I would be going to get a new phone (it was an iphone 5 and since the 5s, 5c, 6, 6 plus, 7, 7 plus were all out and the 8 was coming, I knew they were not going to fix it).

When I was a sophomore in college, I had fallen in love with a girl (*sighs* who knows) and the same issue no response, cold-shoulder, uncertainty, darkness, blank, etc. It hurts emotionally more silence than it does talking and getting closure and knowing something. That doesn't seem to be women's strong suit, closure.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Love is a powerful, painful, perhaps euphoric experience. Lots of ways to connect those two memories, mainly through the theme of idiotic love.

It was during a few days of heavy rain. My roof developed a leak and I had to get the Homeowners Association involved, since I live in a Townhouse. They were pretty quick in responding and sending out a team to put a tarp over the leak. I was surprised with their efficiency as just a couple of days later the roofer came out to fix it.


Memory B:

Last week I was fishing at my local pier when I caught my first Jack Crevelle. It was a fairly decent sized fish that weighed probably 15 pounds. I was fishing in the afternoon with live bait fish I had caught with my cast net. I am lucky that I caught it on my larger fishing pole otherwise I wouldn't have been able to keep him from wrapping me around the pylons of the pier. Overall it was a very memorable experience that I am proud of. 


Memory B:
I also recently went fishing with my 6 year old son and for whatever reason most of the times I go fishing with him we don't catch anything. He becomes bored incredibly easy irritating me very badly. By the time we've been there for a couple of hours catching no fish he's ready to go and gets very unruly. So we just went home. Overall it's just some very bad luck and for me it's extremely sad because I know he will love to fish if only we would actually catch some fish while he's out there.

Last week I learned a problem tenant in the building where I live was not moving, contrary to what the landlord stated in January emails. I spent 18 days away in February because I am not fond of being woke up by screaming and slamming at 3 a.m. But now I have to move because the disruptions are really beyond all reason or sense. It pissed me off and I was absolutely broiling inside, so angry at being deceived by the landlord. But ultimately I believe that everything happens for a reason so I started looking for a new place, grumbling that it's a crappy time of year to move but again readjusted my thinking and decided what better time than when Spring is around the corner. Plus I decided to look for a place that would allow me to have a dog again because dogs are the best and I miss having one. It was a black cloud kind of day but clouds eventually pass.


Memory B:
A few years ago I moved because of drug addict disruptions in the building so yes, the previous memory I wrote about was a very familiar reminder of my previous move. That one ended on Christmas Eve morning at 7:30 a.m. when the landlord's adult child was screaming outside demanding money to feed his addiction. There were little kids involved and the enabling was so incredibly sad. But the ongoing disruptions this ""adult"" child brought to his mother's place of business was too much so I moved. Unfortunately because of the opiate problem, it's become essential to be flexible and ready to go if the time comes that things in a building or neighborhood deteriorate to unacceptable levels. The more current situation mirrors much of the same issues.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both instances involved people unable to manage their problems, specifically addiction problems, who are being enabled by family members to continue indulging their addiction without consequences. Both instances involve unacceptable disturbances at inappropriate times of day and both instances have resulted in me moving my residence.

My sister called me to let me know that she is going to have her twins this Friday.  Today is her final ultrasound before being induced.  If everything goes well today, she will be induced on Friday.  I remember the conversations with her and my mother very well.


Memory B:
I guess the opposite situation happened a few years ago.  My other sister told me that she had a miscarriage.  She had wanted to get pregnant for a very long time but had been unable to, so the miscarriage was a huge blow.

In A, one sister is going to have twins.  In B, my other sister lost her unborn baby.

On May 3rd, 2000 I got married. We didn't have a big wedding, we went down to the beach with a judge and best man and had the ceremony performed there. It was a beautiful warm sunny day with not a cloud in the sky. Afterwards we went and played golf and then my husband, best man and I went to a wonderful restaurant and ate one of the best meals of my life. What a day!

The memory I recall is from today. My ex of 7 years officially told me that we were never going to be able to get back together. He also told me he is in love with his girlfriend of a month. It was a very hurtful thing to hear, but since the end of the relationship is my fault, I deserved the pain of hearing it. He also told me he was coming to get the rest of his stuff and that would be the last time we would see each other.


Memory B:
It reminded me of when I made the worst decision of my life. During one of our many short past break ups, I slept with my ex. I regretted it instantly and cut him out of my life. I never told my boyfriend once we got back together for fear of him leaving me. He ended up finding out months later and did take me back after a week. He said that he tried to get over it for 2 years and couldn't before he broke up with me for good.

Memory B:
This brought to mind the time my husband came home early from work. I noticed some boxes in his truck. When I started talking to him I said ""what happened? You're home early. Did you get fired?"" He answered YES  and that was a shocking surprise, and not in a good way.

Memory B:
Before my friends started their Fall semester during the year 2014, we all decided to go camping at [US NATIONAL PARK]. The drive there from [US CITY] took around 5 hours but the drive was so fun and beautiful, it felt like 5 minutes. The whole time over there was wonderful and I really appreciated my friends. The whole trip was very memorable because we got to witness the meteor shower that was scheduled. I thought that the meteor shower was perfect.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are both similar because I wrote about a time where I bonded with my friends and peers. I think I tend to remember the good moments I have with the people around me.

The day I came to the realization that women are not entirely equal to men in all aspects, and that I had no business being employed as a mail carrier was one when I was given a package to deliver that had to have been at the very top of the weight limit, at the time being fifty pounds.  Being 5'3"" and all of 100 pounds soaking wet, I literally had to drag an incredibly expensive piece of exercise equipment across a long driveway.  The elderly couple to whom it was being delivered were fretting about it getting damaged, trying to help get it onto the porch.  I felt really bad about it.

This memory is easy to recall since it was different than a normal week. My cousins from Australia visited. I haven't seen them for 10+ years and they decided to invite me to come to Disneyland with them. I've been there before but they haven't. I don't recall everything from that day but I remember us having lots of fun on the rides and we spent the the entire day there. I remember going on the ride ""It's a Small World"" as well. Since it was more relaxing then the other rides.

Another specific event from my life that is very dissimilar from the previous one is I remember attending my first NBA game. I was in high school and recently got my driver's license and my parents had bought me a used car.  I decided to invite some friends with me to go to a Lakers game but the tickets we got were horrible and we all the way at the top. The players basically look like ants to us. I didn't mind because the tickets were cheap and affordable to us high school students. I remember that they were playing against the Minnesota Timberwolves. And I got to witness my favorite player, Kobe Bryant, play a game of basketball. I will probably never forget that memory. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
The difference between Memory A and Memory B is that Memory A was a trip to Disneyland with my Australian cousins while Memory B was a trip to a Lakers game with my friends.

My memory was making a decision on a whim. My husband and I were unsure if we should go to a wrestling show that night. We bit the bullet and did it. It was such an amazing and great time as we do not get time together as a couple due to work schedules.


Memory B:
Back in 2017, I knew a local wrestling show was coming to town. The prices were very expensive and was bummed out that we could not afford them at the time. We went out to the mall arcade and had a fun time, I looked one more time to see if the prices have dropped as it was the day of the show. Front row seats for $15 popped up, we bought them and immediately went to the venue. It was our first wrestling show together as a couple.

Last Friday, I went with my children to the local high school football field. My wife called a friend that she had been meaning to take a walk with. Her wife's husband wanted to go to the field with me and the kids, so we picked him up. We all played some soccer, football, and kicked some field goals. After we left the field, we went back to my house and had a couple of drinks and we all played Apples to Apples.


Memory B:
About 10 years ago, my Mom's Oncologist told us that the chemotherapy wasn't working and that the cancer had spread. He said that there wasn't any reason to continue any treatments and that it was time to move on to palliative care.  About six weeks later, she passed away at home.

Last week I stayed at a friend's house all day and late into the night.  We played video games and even made dinner for another friend who joined us.  It was his first time coming to her house to hang out, so we wanted to make it special.  He had so much fun that he stayed until 4 in the morning playing Mario on the super nintendo.  Considering my friend does not often get the house to herself at night, this was truly a once in a year opportunity to come together and have fun.


Memory B:
Another memory that quickly came to mind was when I recently attended my manager's mother's funeral.  It was a beautiful church and I was glad I came due to not many people being able to come.  I had never been in a Catholic church before and so the practices were all new to me.  Despite this mild awkwardness, I felt proud to be there for my friend and coworker during a very trying and stressful time.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They seem to all revolve around friendship and being there for one another.  I seem to prioritize memories based on the people I encounter.  They are highly different in tone, however, and describe two entirely different scenarios.  One is quite happy and the other is very solemn.

This past week I went to a girls get together to celebrate and support a close friend who has cancer.  We called it a ""fuck cancer"" party.  We called it this because of our friends personality and because if she was in a different situation she would have named it the same.  We all brought a gift that would help her through her journey, played games related to 30 Rock, her favorite show, and ate food and drinks also related to 30 rock.  She was surprised and teary eyed because of all the support.  She told us if any of us are ever in her situation she hopes our friends will rally for us as we did for her. 


Memory B:
I've been to several support parties for friends recently and it seems that as I get older more of our friends are passing away or getting sick.  My son's teacher also has cancer and we felt we needed to send her something to get her through her journey as well.  We sent some nausea drops and a nice note.  She was way beyond thankful.

Memory A was fresh in my mind and that's the first thing I thought about when I started the first task because it was memorable and fresh in my mind.  Memory B was something that was completely related to Memory A and it also popped into my mind because of how related it was.

It was the Easter weekend, and on Saturday we decided to rent a some tandem canoes and a couple paddleboards. My cousins came over and had a room in a hotel that's located right on the bay. It was a dog friendly beach so I took my dog as well. We canoed and paddled for a few hours, took a break and went back out. Afterward we had some drinks and had a generally great time.


Memory B:
Jeez, well this is weird. About, 5 years ago at a different bay now, we were also celebrating Easter with some extended family. Another cousin's father-in-law owned a number of paddle boards and we went out there and had a good time. That was the first time I had gone paddle boarding, I remember falling over a number of times. I remember grilling some chicken over coals. They had an RV parked nearby and I think they stayed they night if I'm not mistaken.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:

Last week I had a really great time going out with friends and that experience was really memorable for me. We did a lot of things that spanned over the course of the full day and I thought it was super exciting. We were able to eat two meals, go to the movies, go to a drinks place and go visit a friend's new house too. Overall, it was really memorable because my normal week has way less excitement considering. 


Memory B:
This reminds me of the times in high school where I used to spend extended amounts of time with people from school. Those were great times because we didn't have a care in the world and everything was just carefree fun and entertainment. I wish I would go back to those days because we didn't have to ever worry about much. We were able to spend all the time together after school to do whatever we wanted. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I think Memory A reminded me of Memory B because it gave me a sense of a nostalgic feeling towards the past. Although the past memory is much more generic, it has the same emotions that I felt from Memory A.

This last week my mother and grandmother came to visit my family. I see my mother often, but not my grandmother so this was a special instance. I had been talking about how long I wanted to start a garden and so my mother and grandmother went to local nursery with me and we picked up all kinds of flowers and fresh herbs to plant in my backyard. It was such a simple but special, memorable experience to share with three generations of women in my family.


Memory B:
Another specific memory I can recall was graduating from college. I have always been a hard worker and very studious but nobody in my family had ever graduated from college. This made my graduation a special occurrence. In addition, I graduated with honors and on the dean's list every semester. My entire family was there to watch me receive my diploma and afterwards we all went out to lunch at the local diner. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories are similar in that they involve my family and that was a main factor in what made the memory important to me.

However, when I was tracking my performance against others, I found that there were people who could do 100 in 7 minutes! Although most of my exercise sessions involving this particular exercise is a blur, there was one exercise session last week in particular that was very memorable because I was trying to do it much quicker than I usually do it. In that exercise session, I first did 50 straight in 4 minutes, and my heart was racing and I was sweating profusely, and I couldn't believe how out of breath I was. I ended up only doing 40 more instead of 50 because I just couldn't do it out of fear that I would vomit on my floor. After the exercise session was over, the feeling of pain that I had in my chest was pretty significant and lasted for half an hour. I finally somewhat caught my breath after resting for 15 minutes after the exercise session was over, but still had pain in my chest area.

I love playing golf, but I live in a northern State. After waiting all winter, I was finally able to get out on the course and play a round last Friday. The round did not go well, I lost several golf balls and was very rusty. It was still nice to get out and play again and I'm looking forward to a full summer of golf.


Memory B:
I was playing a round of golf with my good friend. We were at our favorite course, about three miles north of our hometown. We were teeing off on hole #1, a short par 3 hole. I hit what looked like a perfect shot, it was straight at the flag, and landed a bit before the green and rolled on. This hole is slightly uphill, so you can't see the hole, just the flag stick. As we approached the hole, there was no ball on the green. A wave of happiness came over me, because I knew there was only one other place the ball could possibly be. When we got to the hole, sure enough, my ball was in a hole, a hole in one. It was my first hole in one, and I doubt I will have another.

This week we paid a debt settlement for a very large debt that we were unable to make the minimum payments on. The debt had been looming over us and we were slowly digging away at smaller debts to open up more funds to work on it. Through s miracle we were able to borrow money from my husbands 401K in the amount the collectors had asked to settle for. This effectively halved the debt and more than halved the interest on it. Much smaller payments are now taken out of every check my husband recieves and it will be paid back in at most four years. The realization that my husband and I were going to be able to be debt free (besides student loans) before our oldest started kindergarten brought me to tears.

This was before my husband and I combined finances, and while I was aware we were behind on our car payment he neglected to tell me just how rough it was. We were having to pay $500 a month for the program as well as childcare, and despite our optimism and determination we were not making it. The reality of this did not hit me until I walked outside after my classes and couldn't find my car. And after a talk with campus police, a long look at the parking lot cameras, and a shameful hour long ride home from my parents I got to ask a classmate to pick me up for class the next day and then announce to everyone that no, my car was not stolen like I was so freaked out about.

My boyfriend could not handle being there but I wanted to stay with him so they brought me into a room and then brought him and laid him down next to me. He actually looked up and saw me. For an instant he looked like normal and I called out his name. Then he laid his head back down into the oxygen mask they had there to help him breathe.

I was at an amusement park with a girl I was seeing again for the first time in a long while. After a long day of riding rides, we finally came back to the line for a roller coaster we had skipped before because of a seemingly long wait. When we got in line again sometime around six o'clock, the sun was already starting to sink in the sky, but the long rays were still immensely hot. The line was as long as before, and it moved at a crawl.   My companion and I tried to ease the wait by talking a lot about what we wanted to do later after the park or the next day. Our relationship wasn't entirely clear, so although we talked about all manner of subjects and sometimes had physical contact, I was trying hard to feel out the situation. I would sometimes put my arm around her or hold her hand as we waited, and she didn't make any sign that the contact was unwanted.  Towards the end of the wait, it had been almost two hours and we were both drained. The ride itself almost seemed secondary, until we finally boarded and took off down the track. The speed and excitement of the ride seemed to perk both of us up, and we ended the day at the park tired but satisfied.


Memory B:
I remember the day that I was fired from my job as a software developer at a prominent company. Although my peers all seemed to value and enjoy working with me, I had received a bad performance review several months earlier, arising largely from a situation with a manager.  I had been working on a special project by myself as part of a way to save my position, and although I could have probably rushed something in time for the set deadline, I took my time and made sure it was well-made and up to my standards.  However, on this particular Monday morning, a mysterious 8 AM meeting had been scheduled the prior Friday by my manager, with no other explanation. I knew what was coming, and in a way I felt relieved that the stress of the situation would finally be over. Once I was called into the conference room, I sat across the table from my manager and his boss. They called in an HR rep on the speaker phone and the agenda was succinctly laid out: I was being terminated.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories involved important aspects of my life. One is about an experience with a girl that I have strong feelings for and the other is about a pivotal moment in my career. So, in some aspect, both memories are important to me, although for different reasons. However, while one memory is one I fondly recall, the other is largely negative. Although Memory B didn't necessarily involve emotions as heartfelt as those in Memory A, it did affect me emotionally.

Memory A:
I had a very good week. My family was good, my parents were alive, my spouse and I fine, and work was stress free. Normally these are stressors in my life..I tend to worry about each of these separately, though no issues in hindsight. I look forward to a similar week though, ever know. I had an especially great event when friends from college came in for few days, and I was able to spend time with them for catch up.


Memory B:
One month ago, I received a call from father that my mom was in hospital due to a fall. Since they are in different state, I had to arrange ASAP my home/work life to accomodate me being away from home for indefinite period of time without spouse and other support systems. The immediate struggles to manage how my family would be without me is a challenge,  though with my spouse  and friends, I was able to cover most bases.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Memory A is positive and full of hope, Memory B was negative, involved initially unresolved challenges, though turned out okay.

Memory A:
I realized a few days ago that my cat had a limp in his front arm. I quickly made a veterinarian appointment for the next day. After being very stressed, and taking him to the vet - they claimed he had a soft tissue tear. They gave him a mild sedative and instructed me to keep him from jumping and running around the house. 


Memory B:
Three years ago, my other cat was involved in an accident after running away from home. He got hit by a car and ended up losing a tail and leg. The veterinarian encouraged me to keep playing with him and sooner or later he would be back to normal. This has been the case, he is as happy as he ever was.

Memory B:
When I was 12 I remember flying in a stunt airplane.  My brother's neighbor owned the plane and took us up for a flight.  It was so exciting.  I really enjoyed being in the plane and it gave me motivation to want to fly a plane myself one day.

My favorite memory this week was spending time with family. I was with my brother and we were spending the day going to stores and driving. It was nice because the weather was chill instead of hot. We also had interesting discussions about family. 


Memory B:
My 2nd memory was when I was young and not in school yet. I remember being at my families apartment and having pleasant times with my brother. We were playing video games and would go play outside on a nice day. I remember finally finishing a game I was stuck on one day.

Memory B:
My second memory occurred at work. I had a patient that coded. I immediately performed CPR and called for help. This is common in my line of work, but it still ruins my entire day when I lose someone. I did my best to carry on with the rest of my shift afterwards.

We watched the cars practice for a few hours and checked out the vendors too. About 2pm after watching a lot of cars we decided to call it a day. It was a great day.


Memory B:
Yesterday I woke up at 4am because of the time change. This was particularly distressing because I usually wake up at 5am and had to be at work at 9am. I knew I couldn't fall back asleep but somehow a miracle happened and I did. But i had to wake up 20 minutes later, so I ended up feeling terrible most of the day.

I went out of the house.  I went to an electronic cigarette store to get liquid. I was wearing jeans and a black and white striped shirt. My hair color was significantly faded and I was wearing little makeup.  It was snowing, but didn't feel too cold.  As I pulled up to the store, the snowflakes started growing and ended up being the size of a quarter.  I bought atomizers and liquid in the store, stepped in a puddle on my way out.  


Memory B:
In November 2016, I had my left knee replaced at 36. I arrived at the hospital incredibly early and waited in the bed for what seemed like forever.  I wasn't too nervous because I was on the road to feeling like a 36 year old again. The most vivid memory from that day was sitting half naked on an operating table, leaning forward and having someone stick a 50 foot long needle (estimation based on the feeling) in my spine.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
The only thing that would make them similar is that they both took place outside of my home.  The difference is enormous.  Memory A, my body stayed intact.  Memory B, I became part cyborg.

She lived twelve hours and the following morning, when all the sensors started to flatline, we gathered around her and told her we would be fine and that we loved her. In her last moments, she opened her eyes and looked at my dad and me and then passed away.

Last week, after a long recovery from a difficult surgery, my wife wanted to start rebuilding her strength by walking in the Mall. I agreed to go with her, as the mall, especially just after the doors are opened, makes a good and safe area to walk. My only problem was I occasionally get muscle cramping by being on statins, and my back muscles were very sorry when we started walking. So even though she was the one recovering from surgery, I was the one having trouble walking the mall.


Memory B:
I remember well the day my wife and I got married. We got married in a southwestern desert small city. It seldom snows there. Yet on this day a spring blizzard was brewing. It wasn't bad until after the wedding when we were leaving on our honeymoon. The storm came on, desert area and all, and the snow was so bad we could only see perhaps 20 feet ahead. We had to stay overnight at the first town we encountered because traveling was too risky. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
What makes them similar is that my wife and I both experienced them together, though the events were separated by nearly 50 years. What makes them different is that in B it was the elements that put us at risk. In A is was our own health that was problematical.

We spent years taking him to speech therapy, working with him at home and he even went to a special school over 100 miles away, once a week, for a year. Yesterday he had a Hearing In Noise Test for Children. He did so well they said he is hearing better than some people without any hearing loss. That is the first time this test has been performed. He has come so far and all of our hard work has paid off!


Memory B:
That memory takes me back to when he was around two years old. He just got his cochlear implants and he was so little. I had to quit my full time job and he became my full time job. It was spring and I would carry him around with me, narrating everything. We would work in the yard and house together while I told him all about everything. I was supposed to flood him with words so he would learn to understand them and soon start talking on his own.

We went to a Mexican restaurant and spoke for a while, but since we had known one another for years the initial get-to-know period was skipped and we just bantered about upcoming movies, or games we were interested in. Although at the end of it all, we both knew we were just pals but it was a fun night.


Memory B:
I guess the opposite would be a breakup? And that was roughly six years ago. After being in a committed relationship for almost four years, my now ex decided the best way to break up was to date another guy while we were still together and our relationship only ended once I found out and broke it off.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
One is about possibly starting a relationship and having a good time, while the other is about ending one on a miserable note.

I had feelings of relief and satisfaction.

Memory A:
I was cooking dinner for my wife at our house when the stove just out of the blue, quit working. I got really down, because I thought that ""there is one more thing to fix that we don't have the money for"". I looked around for a service man to come out and see what the problem was. He looked at the oven and the informed us what the issue was. The bad news was the part was no longer available and he could not fix the appliance. So, I began looking for a new range, then I discovered that they would cost around $1000 and up, so I decided that I would just buy a small toaster oven until then. So far, everything is working out ok.


Memory B:
It was [DATE] and I was in high school. I had a job as a pizza delivery person. In order to make as money as possible I would deliver pizza on motorcycle because it was more economical on gas. One Saturday afternoon I was out on delivery that turned out to be a prank call. On my way back to the restaurant, I came up to a stop light that was green for me, so I went through the intersection. Just then from out of nowhere, came a pickup truck that ran the light and I hit him. When I impacted his truck, the force of the collision threw me 65 feet and I landed on my back and unconscious. When I came to, I felt as though I was burning since I was laying on the asphalt that was measured to be around 160 degrees. I could not breathe and I remember the ambulance was there. My next recollection, I was in the ER being prepped for emergency surgery. Luckily the bleeding stopped and I didn't have to undergo surgery. I was in the hospital for three weeks and had difficulty walking upright for the next 6 months. To make matters even worse, the driver of the truck never stopped, but called the police department about three hours later to tell them he was driving the truck, when the police asked for his name, he hung up the phone. Over the year I still have very vivid memories about the accident, I will never want to go through that experience again.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I would not think that there is anything similar about the two experiences, but what makes them different, is now that I am older, it is difficult for me to cook and help around the house because of my lasting symptoms from the motorcycle. I have quite a few back and neck problems now that make it difficult to stand for extended periods of time.

I sent my niece a box of gifts. She opened them for me in a video call. When she opened a small box containing a silver butterfly ring she gasped and then squee-ed. She was delighted with her gift.

I spoke to several people over the weekend about topics from the conference and their own ventures. I also got a chance to meet up with a mentor I hadn't seen in a long time. 


Memory B:
An event dissimilar to the last is the last day I was at my day time job. A coworker and I were disposing of some cardboard and other miscellaneous items from our storage area. Our supervisor listed off the miscellaneous items he wanted us to get rid of. This was earlier in the day. That afternoon we began this work and finished in about an hour. As it turns out our supervisor didn't recall telling us about one of the items, and claimed while he didn't want it anymore, he also didn't want to throw it away. He didn't believe us when we told him what he told us that morning. It was resolved, but a very frustrating and common occurence.

Memory B:
A specific memory that I have that closely resembles the one from this prior week is the day I joined and shipped out for the Peace Corps. I traveled along way to end up in a different country when I too was surprised. This moment struck me with surprise and nervousness. After a long time of planning this moment took place and was real.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Memory A reminds me of memory B in that they both share large comonalities. First, each moment required much planning. Each event needed to planned and thought out before it could have been executed. Second, each memory encompassed large emotion aspects. In both memories I was surprise and nervous for the adventure.

The most significant event in the last week for me was turning in a project for one of my classes. This was one of the biggest projects for the semester. I was excited to find out that it was graded the very next day. I was nervous because I waited until last minute to complete it. I ended up getting a 100% on it and it was revitalizing for the upcomng remainder of the semester. 


Memory B:
Any event that was dissimilar to this one was several weeks ago. I was on break from classes and was able to spend the entire time relaxing. It felt good to not have to worry about any sort of school responsibilities. I took each day as it came in a very relaxed manner. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
One way that they were different from one another was my stress levels. In Memory A I had a lot of stress but none at all in Memory B. Another difference was that in A I had a lot of responsibility while B I had none. In A I was not able to be relaxed and was very wound up and tense but in B I was the most relaxed and calm.

She is 94 years old, so there was real worry about not only her heart condition, but what the operation would do to her as well. Luckily, not only did she come out of the operation healthy, they were surprised to not find any blockage and she was released the next day! It was such a relief to hear that news. 


Memory B:
My other Grandmother, on my father's side, had a bad visit to a hospital many years ago that made me worried about this most recent visit. My father's mom had a brain issue that made her lose some function in her body and ended up having to be kept in a nursing home before finally passing away a few years later. She lost a good bit of her memories and my father would visit her and have to remind her about who he was and who his family was. It was really tough and unpleasant to go through for the whole family and there was a worry that it might happen again with my other Grandmother.

Gas prices was fairly high in my state so i went across the river to the neighboring state to get cheaper gas there in my truck. While i was over there i remembered that there was a car dealership that was not too far away from the gas station i was going to get gas at. I set my gps to go to that car dealership because they have the next vehicle i plan on getting because its both large enough for me (i'm very tall) and it gets very good gas mileage. After sitting in it and finding out that i fit very well, i then took it for a test drive and was pretty satisfied with it considering i'm always had large engines in the past.


Memory B:
I had been ill for several years and i no longer had a vehicle or even a drivers license. Last year i felt a little better and pushed myself to get a job, get my driver's license back, and buy a used truck. I decided i didn't want to take a loan so i earned the money before buying the truck. I got very lucky and found a nice full size truck with less than 80k miles for only around $5000.

The most memorable thing that happened in the last week was a power outage that lasted over 14 hours. The power went out overnight because of a bad storm. I woke up and found that everything was off. My first worry was coffee. I hoped that a store nearby still had power, and went to get coffee. I was very happy that they did and I got my much needed coffee. I spent the rest of the day in quiet. I found things to do, like cleaning and organizing closets. I also had plenty of time to read. The power cam back on just around dinner time and my routine returned to normal. I did not like being without power, but I had enjoyed my productive and quiet day.


Memory B:
A similar thing occurred years ago when a hurricane put the power out. It was much worse because the hurricane was ragging outside. It also lasted for several days. It was hard to be without the power for so long. It was quiet after the hurricane went through, but there was damage to fix and it was not very peaceful. Ice for the food was a big problem. It did end, finally and the power came back.

As I was scrolling facebook, I saw a post by my ex's cousin that a friend of ours, [PERSON X] had passed away. My jaw dropped, I was shocked. My friend asked me what was wrong and I told her. [PERSON X] was my ex's best friend and [PERSON X] had been there for me and my family during difficult times. So I was upset and gathered up my kids and left to make phone calls to my family to let them know the bad news.  


Memory B:
Over Memorial Day weekend, I went camping with my dad and 2 kids in the San Antonio TX area. We stayed in a cabin close to a river where were were able to swim, fish and barbecue. We had caught some fish and left them on a rope in the water, some hours later we went to get the fish. And a huge water snake had swallowed one of the fish hole and drowned or choked itself to death. It was really gross and scary, but also kind of cool to see a huge snake that close up. We took some good pictures. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Memory A was a sad and personal event that happened. Memory B was a fun and interesting event. The settings from both memories are very different, an apartment pool vs a campground/river site.

My sister isn't getting along with our cousin as a roommate so she has decided to spend the rest of her lease staying with friends and me to get through it. She showed up Friday night while we were hanging out and the last time she spent a week with us it was awkward. So, when she got here I sat down and had a talk with her about how we can avoid the awkwardness and despite worrying that she wouldn't be that receptive to my ideas she actually loved them and came up with a few of her own. I was not looking forward to having her here all week but it's the third day now and I barely even notice.


Memory B:
When my son was first born he had a heart defect. The doctor knew this but wasn't too concerned with it just yet. A couple weeks later he was diagnosed with Pyloric Stenosis and had to have surgery. An hour before the surgery his pediatric doctor remembered his murmur and decided to order an EKG before surgery. I will be forever grateful that she was thinking and on top of things that day because it was decided that he would need to have the damage in his heart fixed before the stomach surgery could be safely performed.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
The two memories are different because they are about my sister and son respectively. They also deal with issues I had with either of them that had nothing to do with each other. The only similarity is that it involved something happening to unexpected results.

Over the weekend, I drove back to visit my family for Easter. Together, my parents, my siblings, my nieces, nephews and I all went out to brunch together on Sunday. It was a nice meal and it was fun getting to sit down and catch up since we don't see eachother much anymore. We got to eat a lot of food and at the end of it there was an egg hunt for the kids. We all had a good time and it was a nice way to spend a Sunday.


Memory B:
About a year ago, I went back home to visit my family for Easter. To celebrate, my siblings and I all drove up to my parent's house on the Saturday before Easter. All the adults had hidden eggs around the outside of the house for the kids to find. While the kids were finding eggs, my siblings and I all chatted out on the porch and just caught up and reminisced about old times. After the hunt, we ate some pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, etc. that my parents cooked.

However this year I didn't realize that a school ski trip had been planned on the same day and most of her class was going. Instead of 18 kids only 4 showed up. Then it started raining. So not only did I unnecessarily spend a bunch of money the weather was miserable.

It makes me think of her party last year. I was so worried that no one would show up because it was her first year at a new school.

Memory A:
One of my dogs had a sudden and noticeable swelling yesterday morning. I took him to the vet in the afternoon and he was taken to the back for inspection. When the vet called me back they said was of his glands were clogged and about to rupture. They said they drained it as best they could, but suspected an infection and gave me medication for him. I am supposed to keep an eye on the area and call them if it swells up again, and bring him back in a week for a follow up. Apparently this is normally not a big deal, but in his case, if there is an infection it can be dangerous and might require surgery.


Memory B:
I was at my sister's house the other day, and was petting her dog. I felt what I thought was a lump, and was worried for a moment. In the end it turned out just to a small seed with burrs that was tangled up in his fur close to the skin. We cut the seed out of his fur and the dog was fine. He didn't seem to care about the seed either way, to be honest, and probably hadn't even noticed it was there!


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
The seriousness of the situation. In one there is an actual medical problem, in the other it was just a small, essentially aesthetic matter.

Memory A:
I recall being huddled in the hallway with my mil, my husband, bird, sugar glider and dog, as the tornado sirens were going off. The phones were blaring the national emergency sound while the tv weather man was pleading people to take shelter. Then the lights started flickering. We could hear the wind outside as well as the garage door rattling in the wind. The other horrifying memory was feeling the rumbling as my back was up against the door jam. After about 15 minutes we were relived to realize that we and the house is still there and that while the tornado got near enough where we could hear and feel it, it has passed by us. As of writing this we still do not have water though as the water plants still have no power and many homes were damaged.  


Memory B:
watching my grandmother carrying my birthday cake to the dinning room table when I was six years old.  It was a German chocolate cake that she had made from scratch, with the home made caramel and nut like topping. she had put those store bought happy birthday candies on top with a ballerina decal on it. As always for my great grandmother she had pickles on the table as she always had to have pickles with lunch. there was also her floral china placed on the table with one of those plastic like table cloths a lot of people used in the early 80's. It had to of been 1980 since I was six and my great grandma was there. My great grandma also had her bike basket strapped to her walker that was filled with candy that I would always try to steal just to get my hand smacked. My brother was there anticipating the cutting of this cake as it was also his favorite. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories are totally different A. Is recent, B. is 41 years ago. A is a horrible memory, and B. is an awesome memory. The only thing that makes them similar is that I was with people I love in both memories.

Last week I lost my phone after I had gone to the grocery store. I knew that I had it after I left the store, but couldn't find it when I got into the house. I frantically looked everywhere inside and outside in the 6"" of snow that we still have on the ground. I drove to the bottom of my steep driveway to see of I had dropped it when checking the mail. I had....and I procedded to drive over it before I realized that it was laying there.


Memory B:
It reminds me of the last time I both both lost and ruined a phone. I looked everywhere to no avail and just had to take my mind off of it. I decided to do chores and as I was getting the clothes out of the washer, I heard something clank into the bottom of the wash tub. I had left it in a pocket and threw it in the washing machine. This is why I never buy expensive phones.

Memory A:
In the last week one of my neighbors passed away. He also happened to be a good family friend. He had been previously diagnosed with cancer, and in the last couple of days he was preparing to race his beloved drag racing car as a dying wish. I spoke with him about this desire, and he understood that this would likely be one of the last things he would do before passing. A couple days ago, he raced the car successfully and reached a speed of 167 MPH, before dying shortly after from cardiac arrest. This recent memory of him is a good one, because I know this is exactly how he wanted to complete his time here on Earth. Sorry for the grim memory, but it is certainly the most prominent one that I have from the past week!


Memory B:
This memory is a much more positive one. A few months ago my family and I went on a trip to Colorado, one of my favorite places on Earth. It was a fantastic time, and the most prominent memory from the vacation was of me and the family paddle-boarding on the scenic [LAKE] in [COUNTY IN COLORADO]. The water was cold, and the wind was mild. The sun was out without a cloud in the sky, and we enjoyed a panoramic view of the mountain landscape  


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories I would consider to be similar in that they are both equaly existential, but different in that they occurred at completely opposite ends of the spectrum of life. One was a rather grim memory of a family friend passing away and me reflecting on their existence, and the other was a very positive memory of me and my family enjoying a vacation.

On Easter, my husband and I had plans to go to church together, which would have made it the first time we've stepped into a Christian church together. But, our car ended up being in the shop for longer than we were told - plus, I was a little ill that morning - so we were forced to stay at our apartment. But to make up for it, we had ""church"" at our place, watching a preacher on Youtube who's from my home state. I was really happy and grateful that we got to do that together, since going to church is important to me. 


Memory B:
The first memory I had was of going to my old childhood church with my Mom, Aunt, and brother, and giving my life to Jesus as a child. I remember going up to the front and speaking with an older gentleman who lead me to Christ. I'll never forget how I felt the Holy Spirit move in my heart and spirit.

One thing that makes them similar is that they both involved pushing. Although one was pushing objects and the other a person. They both took place in the afternoon.  There are many differences.

It makes me think of my first concert, when I was sixteen years old. This was a far cry from a small show, as it was a Lollapalooza in [YEAR], which was about as big as concerts get.  The one last week definitely made me muse on my first real music experience, though.

I still remember the details and feelings related to winning the county chess club championship as a youth. I was relatively new to the club and only 19 at the time. I had come close to winning in my first try the previous year, and was hoping to do better. The tournament was very challenging, as I had to face the other top players in the club. I remember being very nervous going into the second day of the two day tournament. I was tied for the lead and would face the player who had beat me the previous year. It felt so good to defeat him in a long contest. The final round was a bit anti-climactic as my opponent blundered early in the game which guaranteed me the championship. I had put in a lot of effort over the previous year to improve with the goal of winning, and the satisfaction I felt afterwards stayed with me for a long time.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They both involved experiences that resulted in positive emotions. They both involved achieving something, or enjoying the fruits of my labor. They were different because one was an internal achievement and the other was more of an external stimuli.

My dog had a small growth on his chest that started to grow and change colors a few weeks ago. I decided to take him into the vet, so I called and got an appointment for that same day. The vet examined him and told me that he felt pretty confident it was a benign tumor and nothing to worry about, ultimately. He said if I'd like to be sure, we could have it removed the next morning and send it off to pathology. He said it would only be a short procedure, and that my dog would be home by that evening, so that's what we did. It did turn out to be benign, thankfully.

Those memories are similar in a way because they are strong experiences, but in general they are different per se, the natures are the opposite one affected me in a negative way and the other one make a positive impact on me and my thoughts on life.

I've been fighting all week to get them to refund my money and eBay finally stepped in and let me get it since the seller wouldn't admit they scammed me.

Six day ago i was sick with a cold and spent most of the day in bed with a reoccurring fever. Sicknesses in general tend to make it difficult for me to do anything given all my focus is towards how unwell i feel so i didnt work while sick and was mainly at home. I also did not get much sleep during this time as i could not breathe through my nose due to it being inflamed. It has been probably 10 years since i last had the cold and i forgot how miserable it is when it is at its worst.

I guess it reminds me of the last time i was sick with the cold which was in my early twenties. At the time i was working at a construction company and someone else there got sick and irresponsibly came to work and spread it to others including me.

This is upsetting and I'm disappointed because he has been in NJROTC since his Freshman year and he's about to finish his Sophomore year, and each time there's an aware ceremony he's told us he's getting promoted, yet he still has NOT done so. Freshman are getting promoted and I feel so down on his drive and ability to do things in life that I was unable to.

I also played an elaborate board game with some people that was a more satisfying experience than usual. I cannot think of anything else remarkable that has happened to me recently, so I guess it was memorable to have some weekly experiences that I usually have that were unusually pleasant, relative to what they usually are.


Memory B:
I can directly compare this experience to other ones that are similar that I regularly have - I think I already did, so some extent. I usually get food from either the place I went or another place, and the food is typically almost as good - I am just usually less able to enjoy it in the moment. As I also mentioned, I also play the same kinds of games with the same people regularly, but the experience is not always as ""peak"". Sometimes I do not perform as well in the game, or other parties act in ways that make the experience less enjoyable or memorable. This is definitely an experience that I compare to other ones because it is somewhat special, but not entirely unique in terms of what I experience.

We went to the corner and saw the bus running with the lights out. We approached the bus and knocked on the windows but there was no response. We began walking back to the bus stop when all of a sudden the lights came on inside the bus and the engine turned over. This is when I realized the driver was inside the bus asleep. We made it to the scheduled line up because the driver drove like a maniac to get to the bus depot on time but I was still very upset with the wait and felt the driver was inconsiderate.

A memory that is very dissimilar is my mother getting borderline pneumonia the weekend before.  To start the week, particular Monday, she was very sick.  I went to go walk her dog for her, but she didn't answer her door.  I have a key, so I went inside and although she was just asleep on the couch it scared me to see her motionless when I've been so worried


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
The emotions brought forth.  Memory B is scary and worrisome, while Memory A is fun and superficial.  I imagine Memory A feels so much better because it happened so soon after the worry of Memory B.

We hosted a potluck on Saturday which several of my roommate's friends attended. I made vegetarian enchiladas and triple fudge brownies. A few people brought pizzas, and one person cooked potatoes.

Memory B:
Our sewer line got backed up. Every time we ran water in the house, sewage came up through the drain in the basement. It smelled like feces down there, and we were unable to use any water at all in the house until a plumber came out and snaked the drain. It was pretty jarring, and made me realize how much we take running water for granted.

No one was hurt.  No property was hurt.   I backed up and drove to work.  Still scary thinking about it.

Memory B:
I got into a fender bender once, years ago. I'd been on my way to work, and I was definitely rushing.

A memorable event that occurred to me within the past week was my 20th birthday. This will be a memorable event to me because I did a lot of great activities on this day. I consider turning 20 to be a small achievement because many people don't even get to live that long. On top of that, I also enjoy the fact that my adolescence is officially over. Overall, this event was one of the most important in my life and I hope to look back on it many years from now.


Memory B:
Yes, this event reminds me of my 18th birthday. My 18th birthday and 20th birthday shared a lot of similarities in the sense that I felt that maturity came with this age. On my 18th birthday, I did many similar things, such as having a nice dinner with friends and family. On top of this, I feel that the 18th birthday is very memorable because you are finally a legal adult. This was similar on my 20th birthday because leaving adolescence made me feel like an actual adult.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I think that Memory A reminded me of Memory B because these are two extremely important birthdays in ones' life. While turning 18 leads to legal majority, turning 20 feels like you are more mature because you're no longer a teenager. On top of this, I had very similar 18th and 20th birthdays in the sense of activities that I did. Although these memories aren't exactly the same, they share a lot of similarities.

It was wonderful to be able to sit and relax and visit with her again.

The previous memory reminds me of another event that occurred several years ago.  I was getting ready to move out of state and my mother and I went to one of our local historic parks to eat lunch and sight-see.  I remember the weather being beautiful and sunny.  We had a wonderful visit together and have talked about that event many times over the years.  We have even talked about returning to the park again someday.

Memory B:
I remember a particular event which I regretted because I felt that I handled it to poorly. It was the time right after a earthquake had hit a country in which people ended up dying and/or losing their homes and valuables. I remember this incident because after this incident was publicized, one of my boss thought it was funny to make a joke regarding the people that was crush by collapsing buildings. When I head it I was shocked and disgusted that someone could joke about peoples death like that but sadly I myself decided not to do or say anything. I regret that decision every time I think of it.

I would say they are more different then similar. For example Memory A is more of a personal concern that doesn't necessary affect my in any major way besides a slight discomfort.

I was in line at the DMV waiting to get my license renewed. Actually it wasn't a line, I was standing at the window. I handed over my completion code on a scrap of paper, indicating my electronic form had been filled out. My license had expired unbeknownst to myself, and I needed a renewal stat. I had been driving on an expired license. Within seconds, the clerk told me that my license had also been suspended. She didn't even have enough time to review it, from what I can tell. That was a surprise. She was very cordial and understanding, though.


Memory B:
It absolutely does no remind me of any other specific memory in my life, at all. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. It did cause me to think about other DMV experiences, though, none of which were significant in any way. I do remember in past years, when I was less wise, and I remember being surprised by the amount of paperwork. It's quite different now, but I'm still stuck in the old days of expecting bureaucratic hurdles like you wouldn't believe. I remember how difficult it was to do a change of address, and not being able to get a license in one single trip, because I needed to fill out some separate form that I didn't have the information for. I remember that folded up piece of paper and feeling defeated.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Primarily because I wrote until Memory B was prodded out of me. the writing process called up the memory. As demonstrated, the memory wasn't there until I wrote. The specific incitement was that both happened at the DMV. So it was the common location that called up the second memory.

I had a memorable even occur last week. I was not feeling great mentally and was getting more and more anxious. I was upset and not figuring out a good way to work through it so I decided to go for a drive. I stopped shortly after leaving the house, at a small grocery store. I texted a friend of mine and told her I was not doing great and I needed to talk. She messaged me back right away and said she was available but had to make a quick stop and would call me asap. I texted back ""ok"" and then looked up and she had just pulled into the same parking lot I was at. I instantly felt better and she ran over and was shocked that we were in the exact same place in that moment. I will never forget that. 


Memory B:
I remember the day I found out I was going to have my twins. I was bothered that morning and my MIL asked me if I felt something was wrong. I told her that I didn't think anything was wrong just ""different"". On the way to the appt with my husband and 3 year old son, our son announced that he was going to have a brother and a sister. My husband and I laughed and said we were just going to have one so he would have to pick. Our son became very insistent and refused to let it go. As the ultrasound began I noticed two black circles right away. I joking looked and my husband and son and said ""oooohhhh twins"". Then the ultrasound tech said ""wait a minute"" and sure enough. Two babies. It was quite an event. But so joyous. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:

I was around 10 years old and played baseball with almost all boys (I'm female). I was the only female on the team and maybe the only one in the entire league. Anyway, I was not too great at it, but I wasn't terrible. One time I was playing right field and either a ball got hit to me or someone overthrew a ball and I ended up getting it. There was a baserunner who was trying to get to home and I threw a perfect throw from right field and nailed the dude at home plate. This is not an easy feat for a 10 year old (two 10 year olds, one throwing and one catching) and the memory has stayed in my mind since then.

I remember looking out the window of the train as I was on my way to class. A creek facing my window caught my eye as the reflection from the sun hit it. It gave me a deep appreciation for life and where I am living. It put me in a good mood before class.


Memory B:
I have noticed a similar appreciation several times. One, in particular, was from last summer when I visited Grand Teton National Park for my first time. As soon as my eyes saw Mormon Row for the first time ever, I was captivated by the landscape and it evoked a feeling of deep appreciation. An appreciation for being alive and living in such a beautiful country. This feeling made me forget the current political hostilities in our country and respect the beauty of nature.

I became a bit anxious as I am LGBTQ (gay) and knew that he hated me and possibly would like to see me dead. Then I remembered some of readings on why people are attracted to neo-Nazism and I thought of my vow to treat everyone with compassion, even Nazis. I do this because I believe that membership in Nazis and other extreme groups do not have to be forever and treating people with compassion is a step in taking them away from those groups.

A memory I have from my past is when I married my husband. We've been married for almost 20 years. We celebrated the day with many family and friends. It was a very loving and fun day.  


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories are happy memories. They both deal with close family members; my husband and a child we have together. They are different because one deals with something someone else achieved and the other is something that I was a main subject in.

Yesterday I got a very large bonus. From a HIT I earned a $27 bonus. This was really great because I wasn't expecting it and I hadn't earned much on MTurk that day, so it really made up for the slow day. I was very excited and relieved to get the bonus email. I doubt I'll ever get a bonus that large again. It made me happy.


Memory B:
Back when I used to play the lottery, I won a prize of $500. I don't generally play the lottery but sometimes I think, what the heck? I won $500 and I was very excited.

I met up with the mother of my daughter for a chat about my daughter, and we both agreed that my daughter had been having some self esteem issues. This meeting, while cordial, was concerning to me as I don't want my daughter to have any self doubt about herself. We ended up talking for about 2 hours about our concerns and making a plan as to how we're going to go about things to help her. The meeting as at her place as well, and it was nice to be able to have a conversation with her like this after years of fighting.

I discovered that my car had been making some noises when braking, and I didn't want to get into an accident. I decided to then take my car to the shop to have it looked at, and left it overnight as the technician went home before I got there.

My sister was in a pretty bad car crash a few years ago. Her car had been T-boned by a reckless driver and was flipped over on its side.

We finally won a league championship! We all give this crazy hug in celebration knowing all the effort and pain it took to get here.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
The two memories are both similar because they are both doing something athletic with a bunch of friends.  They are different because the basketball I was at the peak of my skills and its just more competitive than regular going to the gym stuff.

I went to walk my friends dog and feed her.  She's a medium sized mutt, brown and white.  I walked her down the street and around the block.  She doesn't have much in the way of manners and pulls on her leash a lot.  She's quite strong. 


Memory B:
I took my cat to the vet last week.  He's been a great deal in the last month and is tired of it.  The vet tech left the sliding door open and he bolted for it.  I had to chase he through the office.  I remember being very glad that the glass door was closed, otherwise he'd have been outside. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both involve animals being difficult.  In my cats case it's justified.  My friends dog is just very poorly trained and lacks manners.

I took my dogs out in our fenced in backyard. I walked around for a bit and enjoyed the fresh air. My neighbor told me to have a happy easter and I told them the same. My dogs played for a bit, getting kinda dirty and then we went in the house.


Memory B:
I remember going to six flags with my family. It was a very long drive and it wasn't pleasant, but I was very excited when we got there. It was one of the most fun times of my life. The only negative time after we got there was my grandma needed to be taken off a roller coaster because she was feeling ill. She was pretty much okay after that, but it was a scare.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I guess something that makes them similar is that they were both relatively pleasant memories. However, there's nothing really similar beyond that. They're different in that Memory A is rather mundane and an everyday memory while Memory B is more memorable, happened much longer ago and was a bigger event in my life.

I was in the backyard doing gardening work. We just laid cement in one part of the backyard and the area around it was really messed up. I had to dig out the extra dirt and wheelbarrow it out to make sure the ground was level with the cement. Then I added gravel on top to make it look a bit nicer.


Memory B:
I recently started my oldest son in swimming classes. His first class was about three weeks ago. He was pretty nervous because he is rather shy but fortunately the swimming instructor was really nice and comforting. I remember watching him start off really slow and scared but by the end of the lesson he was actually laughing and enjoying himself and didn't want to leave.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Perhaps the only similarity is that both are outdoor memories. The differences are that the first memory had to with yardwork and something I had to do and the second memory was more fun and watching my son have a good time.

Memory A:
I left work for my lunch break, and was heading to a nearby establishment by car to get some food. Someone in a Charger cut me off in the middle of an intersection. The intersection had one of those mandatory right turn lanes, and the Charger driver went straight (on my right), only to swerve left before the road ran out. I had to slam on the brakes and swerve slightly left as well, almost side swiping the car to my left. 


Memory B:
A few years ago I was heading home after working the night shift as a security guard at a truck yard. I turned right onto the street from the yard, because the car already driving on the road was at least 200 meters away - plenty of time for me to get on the road ahead of them. After I had already merged onto the street, a white pickup truck stopped in the street to make a left turn into a giant construction area (it was one lane each way, so they had to come to a complete stop and wait for oncoming traffic to pass). I stopped safely behind the pickup truck, but the car that I had seen previously (who was now behind me) didn't get the memo and slammed right into the back of me at about 30mph. I was driving an old [CAR MODEL], and the car that hit me turned out to be a really nice (and new) [CAR MODEL]. My rear bumper was dented, and the Mercedes ended up totaled. They don't make 'em like they used to.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They both involves automobile accidents - one potential, one actual.

I was off work yesterday, and I was working in my yard between 2 and 4.  I was pulling weeds in the flowerbeds.   I plan to put down mulch this weekend, so I wanted to make sure they were ready by doing my weeding ahead of time.  I had to be careful because I had planted some bulbs and seeds, and I did not want to pull them up by mistake.


Memory B:
Yesterday before I worked in my yard, I went running.  I parked in a church parking lot and ran down a narrow winding road.  The breeze was blowing, and the scenery was beautiful.  Only one car came down the road while I was running.  It was a nice peaceful run.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
In both cases, my memories were of me being outside in nature.  Both of them involved physical exertion.  Memory A was physical exertion that was a chore or job that needed to be done, while Memory B was physical exertion done for exercise.  The two memories took place in different locations.

Memory B:
In the fourth grade I was watching one of the pirates of the Caribbean movies with my family. I remember being extremely uncomfortable as the movie went on. By the end of the movie I was almost in tears because my stomach was hurting so badly. my mom pressed her hand on it very gently and I cried out in pain. She took me to the emergency room where the gave me a cat scan. They didn't find anything wrong so I went home and the following day they called and asked her to bring me in ASAP for surgery, It turns out my appendix went bad and the doctor working the previous night missed it on the cat scan.

I spoke lovingly to my fiance. We have had a good as well as a bad week. Feeling very close to each other but also being at odds for half of the week. Communication had been very strained and emotions ran right for the first half of the week that was positive as well as the second half of the week that was negative.

So that is what I did, it took about an hour there and back. I stopped at the dollar store and [GROCERY STORE] on the way back home. I went to find ""Vital Wheat Gluten"", but they didn't have it. At the dollar store I got some needed groceries. When I got home I worked on mTurk some more and then made dinner.


Memory B:
I'm not sure if you want something from yesterday or not, the instructions were not that clear. But yesterday I also just remembered that my neighbor said he'd cut a couple of ceramic tiles I need to cut because I want to put them on a table top in my house. So, between working on mTurk hits, I measured the table top and marked the tiles where I need them cut. I just have to bring them over to my neighbor for cutting. It is four tiles and I need about 21/32 inches cut off each end.

I was trying to find and install different packages to get my newly installed OS working to specs i'm used to.  I going between places, from my computer to my closet and also to the basement in search of disks for drivers.  I was also curious if I could use the change to better create a desk environment and virtual environment to suit my needs better (like toying with a dual monitor situation).  2 dogs were sleeping in the room with me.

I was in [EUROPEAN CITY] on a study abroad field trip.  Fellow American students and I had found [EUROPEAN CITY] natives to hang with.  We traveled on a subway to get to their part of the town, buying beer on the way and drinking it as we go.  We entered their domicile ( an apartment a couple floors up) and chilled and chatted in a room.  Eventually most of the group moved into the other room, but being a bit drunk and mentally tapped out I chilled where I was at.  One of the residents, who happened to be a Russian immigrant, asked me in a polite way that I should come with the others.  I thought to myself vaguely, ""oh my, I hope she didn't think I was lingering by myself hoping to secure an opportunity to steal something"".  Clearly her asking came off with the vibe that she didn't trust me to stay there by myself, though was of course understandable.  That unsettled me a bit and I didn't particular enjoy the rest of visit there at that domicile. We left an hour or 2 later.

There was a special promotion going on, so we arrived before the shelter opened.  There was already a small line forming.  Everyone was pleasant and not pushing or shoving, but everyone was excited to look for a new pet.  All of the people were a bit overwhelming for me, so I made my way over to a less crowded area which landed me right in front of a sweet little calm dog.  After viewing one dog, I met with the little sweet calm dog.  I instantly knew she was the one, and we went right in and got our application for adoption approved.

How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are similar because they happened in the same place.  They are different because they describe two different events that are not related to each other.  They are similar in that they both happened to me.

Memory A:
At this time I was at McDonald's with my family yesterday. We were in the play area and my daughter was in a high-chair eating. My son was on the table in his car seat sleeping. And my husband and I were eating. There were also cartoons on. 


Memory B:
The first memory that came to mind was my son's birth. I remember them trying to find his heartbeat and how my memory suddenly skips to pushing. Then I remember him coming out but he was not crying, because he had the cord around his neck. Then they just unwrapped it and he started crying and he was fine. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are similar in the fact that my son is in both. What makes them different is that they are completely different events and months apart. Also, one is strictly about my son.

I was trying to exercise, but my cat kept meowing at me. She's too cute to resist, so I ended up giving her attention instead and stopped working out. She's really into tissue paper right now, the kind that come with gifts. At least she got the work out instead!


Memory B:
I went to a Tulip Festival a couple of weeks ago. Since our Spring has been a bit timid, not all the tulips were in full bloom. However, my friends and I still had a good time and took lots of pictures. It was nice to see the hot air balloons among all the flowers.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They're very different. Memory A is being at home with just my cat, as Memory B is being outside with my friends. However, both memories were somewhat joyful memories.

Yesterday between the [TWO-HOUR TIME WINDOW] I was on mturk looking for work. I had got a hit around that time and was looking at some articles. Some of the articles pertained to [TOPIC X]. Another was about [TOPIC Y].


Memory B:
This one happened a few years ago. My best friend was ghosting me for 20 days or so by this point. I had messaged him one last time on a different profile and he sent one of his friends to mediate between us. That ended up being the official end to my friendship of 7 years.  


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Nothing makes them similar. What makes them different is many. Memory A I was focused on making money, primarily to hang out with friends this saturday. Memory B on the other hand was a very dark time for me. I was lonely, depressed, and friendless at that point compared to how loved I feel now.

Yes, I was extremely sick and dizzy from the flu, trying to work from home. I was so ill that focusing on anything was very difficult. I pushed myself, but I did it from bed, which made it easier.


Memory B:
One that comes to mind is when a love interest called me on the phone, a day before he was going to move to my state, and he told me that he wanted to hear me say I loved him. It was unexpected, heartwarming, and it took me by surprise. At the time, it was a good thing.

Yesterday between 2 and 4 pm I took my puppies for a walk. I knew that rain was in the forecast for today and I wanted to get them outside before it hit. I took them on a trail close to my house and we walked for 3 miles. We stopped at a creek and they had a little play there. It was a beautiful afternoon to be out with them. 


Memory B:
An event from my life that sticks out to me is a recent cruise my husband and I took with our 2 daughters. I think this was a very special vacation because it was possibly the last family vacation the 4 of us will be able to take together now that they are both off in college and on different schedules. The highlight of our cruise was going to [TROPICAL ISLAND] and seeing the Stingrays. It was amazing and like nothing I have ever done before. Sharing that with my kids was amazing. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I think what makes my 2 memories similar is that I was spending time doing something I love with loved ones. The biggest difference is in Memory A it was my dogs and Memory B was with my husband and kids. In both memories I was also outdoors enjoying life. I think they are both similar because they are positive, happy memories.

Memory A:
Around 4pm-6pm I can recall the beginning of a thunderstorm. I was upstairs, sitting on my bed in my bedroom with the window open and my dog by my side. I was writing. The air got warm and humid, and the sun was going down. I had a box fan on, whose white noise mixed with the start of thunder in the distance. The strength and speed of the rain slowly picked up, as did the wind. The smell of wet, warm pavement drifted through my window. 


Memory B:
My second memory is from middle school, when I went on a trip to an amusement park in my state with an after-school extracurricular group I was a part of. The park was a couple of hours away from my home town. I believe it is the first time that I went on a trip without my family, even if it was a short one. I can recall being blissfully happy that day, absolutely unencumbered by anxiety or discomfort. I'm not sure why; that sort of thing would have normally made me nervous. But I felt very open and accepted with that group, and had an immense amount of fun that day as a result. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Well they're quite different! Memory B is from when I was a child, Memory A is from adulthood. I think the second memory was triggered by the first for some reason: there was definitely a storm at some point in my trip in Memory B, but I think the main link was that I was very content in both of them. Wanting very little, feeling free and happy. Calm. It's a rare state for me!

Yesterday, I was invited to take part in a Diwali gathering from around [TWO-HOUR TIME WINDOW], and meet with my family, but I did not do it. Instead, I did some work on amazon mechanical turk and ran some errands. One errand involved picking up some dairy products from a remote location. One item was missing from my order. It was goat buttermilk.


Memory B:
My second memory involves my brother visiting from [US CITY]. The change from the last time I saw him was visible, as he had sported a longer beard and gained some weight. This is the good kind of weight, as he was always on the skinny side. We caught up on certain topics, although the stay was short lived.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
There is little similarity in these memories, other than having to do with family. One memory had to do with tasks (working on mturk, picking up groceries, while the other had to do with an interpersonal relationship.

During this time frame, I was spending time with some of my friends on [MESSAGING APP]. We were discussing favorite characters from TV shows and series. Things were kind of heated for the majority of the discussion. There was a good bit of bad blood afterwards when the discussion died down.


Memory B:
I remember as a child spending a lot of time with my family. My cousins and siblings  would spend a lot of time together due to the proximity in which all of our families lived. In particular, we would create a lot of fort like objects in the living room. We would spend hours into the night playing around and having fun.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
What makes them similar is the fact that they're very social memories involving a lot of people. What makes them different would have to be both the groups of people in them and the emotions associated with the memories.

I downloaded the required software and made several test streams to check the quality of the video and the sound. I was disappointed because the audio quality was really low. I tried adjusting the settings to the software and my PS4 and spent some time reading about how to make the quality better.


Memory B:
Today is Easter. I remember several years ago on Easter, I was alone in my apartment relaxing. I was in bed eating ice cream and watching Scandal on my iPad. Throughout the day my doorbell rang several times, but there was no one there. I had the window in my living room open. I lived on a busy street, but the street was really quiet because not many people were outside. I heard a crash in my living room. When I went to look I saw that a man had climbed in my window, knocking out my AC unit, to break into my apartment. When he saw me he ran back out. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Well, they start off similar in the sense that I was alone in my apartment and doing something to relax. They happened at different times of the day. I was frustrated during Memory A, but during Memory B I felt scared and really unsettled.

And another one, etc. etc. By the end of my working period, it ended up being one of the best money making days on mturk.

I was going to Australia to meet a friend. The week before, everything that could happen did. My suitcase broke, my dog got sick, the electricity in the whole house went out, my ride to the airport cancelled and then my car tires needed replacing. Anyway, my brother told me to just go and he'd take care of the electricity problem and take my dog back to the vet to have him double-checked. Then I went to Australia.

My team was pretty disappointed with the vendor's presentation.  After about 10 minutes, we decided that the product wasn't for us.  That made the remaining 50 minutes of the presentation seem to drag on forever.  It was quite boring.

Yesterday around the time between 12:00 pm and 2:00 pm, I did a few activities. Firstly, I ate lunch. This consisted of 1 meat patty (made of turkey and pork), 1/3 cup of red beans, and some mixed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower). After eating, I went straight to the bathroom to brush my teeth and to take a shower. After I finished showering at 1:15 pm, I got dressed and played video games for a few minutes until 2:00 pm.


Memory B:
A random specific memory that I thought of was one that happened many years ago. To be more specific, it happened 23 years ago in 1996. It was my brother's birthday and we were coming back home from the mall. My brother received two video games for his birthday: Super Mario RPG and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, both for the Super Nintendo. When we got home, my parents prepared a small inflatable pool in our backyard and my brother and me jumped in and played for hours. During this time, my mom and dad grilled some burgers and baked a cake. So after we finished playing in the pool, we got to eat burgers and cake. Then we continued to play in the pool until about late afternoon. We both showered and then my brother went to play the games he received for his birthday and I sat next to him and watched him play. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They're completely different. Memory A is a recent memory constrained to a specific time yesterday and it involves something extremely mundane and uninteresting that I do practically everyday. Memory B is a memory from a long time ago and it involves something more meaningful. It involves a time from my childhood where there were no worries of any kind and we all had fun and celebrated my brother's birthday. Memory B involves a strong sense of ""togetherness"" and nostalgia.

Yesterday about 30 minutes after noon, our Internet went out (and frustratingly was out until this morning). I remember trying for about an hour and a half to reset the router, the modem, doing lots of research from my phone, trying to figure out what the issue was. My roommate pays for the Internet, and I don't have her login details, so at the time I was unable to check if it had anything to do with the provider. During that time I remember being very frustrated and bored, as it completely hindered my ability to get any work done and highly stressed me out.


Memory B:
This is a fairly recent memory, last weekend I had gone out of town to be with some friends. It was an okay weekend trip all in all. One of the things we did was go to the coke museum. I am not a coca cola fan, but it was a very interesting place to go, especially because they had a section where you can try many different sodas from across the world. I remember, however, that I specifically tried an Italian soda called Beverly. It was, well, awful. I almost immediately puked on this already incredibly gross and sticky floor. I ended up washing it down with lots of Poppin' Pink Lemonade High-C, which was funnily enough my highlight for the place. I'm a huge fan of that specific flavor of High-C, but it's very hard to find. The normal lemonade High-C is pretty awful in my opinion.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Hmm, there's not anything I would really consider about them that is too similar, besides the fact that they both had negative things in them. However, Memory A did not have a high point, whereas Memory B does, and was generally more enjoyable, even if it included a disgusting experience.

I remember going to the park near my house to climb a tree. It was spring time, and when I went into the woods, I found a small opening in the trees where is looked like someone had built up a half-hearted fortification. The tree that was right below it was the perfect climbing tree. It was dry and dead and let me get really high without any effort at all.

I was cooking something to eat at first then my phone rang and it was the leasing office at the place I applied for calling. They told me that I met all the requirements and that I could move in as soon as possible. I thanked them so much and then I hung up and just kinda screamed. I was so excited and overwhelmed with joy because I had been hoping and praying that I got this place because it's perfect for me.


Memory B:
I remember the day that I bought my first ever CD with my own earned money. I had made money selling candy at school that week and one of my favorite bands at the time, Three Days Grace, had a new album out so I decided to go to Target and buy it. I asked my aunt to take me, so she drove me to Target and waited in the car while I went inside. Once inside I walked over to the album section and picked up Three Days Grace's ""One-X"" CD and brought it to the register and paid for it. After I walked out of Target and got back into my aunt's car I couldn't stop smiling and giggling because I was just so happy. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
The thing that makes these two memories similar is that they both are events that made me so excited and happy. And the thing that makes both of these memories different is that Memory A takes place in present day, when I'm an adult, and Memory B took place when I was a kid.

Memory B:
I went on a family vacation to Miami, Florida. We traveled by plane, and stayed in a hotel for a week. We visited the beach almost everyday because the weather was beautiful. We even took an air boat tour of the Everglades.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
What makes these two memories similar is that they both consisted of a pleasurable experience that I enjoyed. What makes these two memories different is the length of time each memory occurred for, and that I was alone in memory A and with others in memory B.

I worked on Mturk for a couple of hours before I started dinner. We just got faster internet & I hooked up a new mouse to my computer to make things faster. I was checking out how everything worked. I was pleased with the results.

Memory B:
I heard my husband yell something about cats downstairs. He came upstairs and said, ""The next time a cat chews threw a cord, I'm getting rid of one of the cats!"" I could tell he was very frustrated. My son started to cry because he thought his father was being serious about getting rid of a cat.

Around 11 am, I went out biking. It wasn't very far: just around the neighborhood. I was alone, and it was a very pretty day. The sun was shining, but it wasn't very hot, not yet, so that made for a very pleasant experience. 


Memory B:
Another event from my life would include the day I got mugged. I remember the event very clearly, even though years have passed: a druggie followed me into my apartment building (foolishly, I held the door open for him), got with me into the elevator, and the confronted me with a knife. I lost my wallet and phone that day.

Memory B:
In high school, an old friend who I hadn't been close to in a long time and I met up for coffee. We had coffee in the shop and talked about our lives, especially our boyfriends. We went for a walk around outside. She smoked a cigarette and discarded the stub on the ground near the elementary school, which made me angry, so I picked it up and threw it away.

When my nan passed away I went to a denial period, where I would wake up and still call her. My pap eventually stopped answering the phone because it was just too much for him.

There are times I remember just feeling like life was over at this time.

Memory A:
Yesterday during those hours I tackled the plastic bag ""collection"" I've accumulated from various stores. They've taken over two entire clothes baskets. It was out of control. So, yesterday afternoon, around 3 pm or so, I sat on the floor of the family room and one by one took the bags, straightened them and folded them into small squares. It was a tedious process, but it was a gorgeous Fall day outside and I had the sliding door open and the breeze came through the room.


Memory B:
It was the first day I took horseback riding lessons. I was 10 years old and the lessons were $10 a session. I used my own money to pay for the lessons, money I had gotten from holidays and birthdays. I was able to take lessons for a year and a half until my money ran out, and it was a wonderful time. However, the first lesson I had ended quite badly. I had been given a horse to ride that was quite tall and after the lesson was over we all were to dismount in the outdoor arena. Most of the parents had shown up by then to pick up their kids. Well, since it was my first lesson, though I had ridden a few times before, I had never dismounted on my own. I made the mistake of letting my shoe slip too far into the stirrup on the dismount and when I swung my other foot over the horse and to the ground, my left foot stayed in the stirrup at about my now shoulder-level. And then, as I struggled to disentangle my foot from the stirrup the horse started to move. I hopped a few times to keep up, but inevitably I was dragged around the corral, my hair getting all dirty and dusty. Of course, the instructor was soon there to stop my horse, but my embarrassment that I had made such a mistake remained.  


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Other than they both happened to me I'd say they're very different. A similarity is that I start out by stating the general time the memory happened. The differences are that when I'm allowed to recall any memory (memory b) I could easily write a lot more, because it was more vivid than memory a, when nothing in particular happened to me. I also find memory b more exciting or at least more memorable. Another difference is that in memory a nothing bad happens and in memory b I was dragged by a horse. They are also at very different times in my life, though they may have happened around the same time of year.

I thought of the last [ROCK BAND NAME] concert I ever got to go to. Back in [MONTH] of [YEAR] me and my dad flew to [US CITY] to see Rush then flew back home to [US CITY] to see them the night after. It was such a good time and something I miss doing with my dad. I was thinking of how we got such good seats and were almost touching the stage. The lead singer came out and acknowledged us, that's how close we were. Such a good time, something I will never forget


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
A is just a typical ""day in the life"" sort of thing that I may never think of again. I might when I buy coffee creamer but its nothing like the amazing time I had in B. B was something I will cherish, was so amazing that we got to do that together.

Arrived in [US AIRPORT] in afternoon and was met by my brotherinlaw with his trailer attached to his vehicle and all his belongings in it. He was moving to Oregon so we left immediately from [US AIRPORT] to make the 17hr trek, straight through, to OR. By the time we made it the sun was shining and due to no sleep I was exhausted and slept for 8 hrs!


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I guess the differences would be what I did, who I did it with, and the time involved. In memory A it only took a few hours of my time were memory B took me almost 24 hrs and required recovery time. Other difference would be memory A was with my daughter were memory B was with my brother-in-law.   As for similarities I would say the main one would be both memories involved family members who I am close too. Another similarity would be both memories involved me being a part of events in both parties lives that were important to them and I shared in those important moments with them. Another similarity would be I immensely enjoyed my time with both persons and we bonded over those experiences/memories.

They both contributed to my health.  My eating, or desire to eat, was probably increased by my increase activity the day before.  They both took place in the same general area.

My sister's birthday was a month ago and it was terrible. All of us--myself, my sister, and other family members--had planned on seeing a concert, but before that, we went to a restaurant. My poor sister got extremely sick and couldn't stop vomiting. She was too sick to go to the concert. She begged us to go on without her and we absolutely refused. She pleaded with us again, saying she didn't want our tickets to go to waste. So we decided to go to the concert. One of us stayed behind to drive my sister home, but the rest of us headed to the concert. We went to the will call office to pick up our tickets and--surprise!!--we didn't have the receipt to show we already paid for our tickets online! It was still in my sister's pocket, who was already home and in bed by that point. Since we didn't want to pay the huge ticket price again, the rest of us crammed into 1 car and headed home. ...Or we would've been heading home if our TIRE didn't explode. We had to wait two hours for a tow truck. That's karma getting us back for abandoning our sick friend.

Memory B:
I remember last year I made a decision to change my style. By style I mean the way I dress. Usually I try to stay in fashion but I found that doing this was causing me to spend more money on clothing then what I felt was necessary. So my new style is taking simple and plain colors that match. I'm sticking to basic shirts and pants that are all interchangeable with each other. This allows me to spend less on clothing and also saves time when getting dressed. So far it has worked out very well for me. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
What makes both memories similar are they both have to do with how much time constraints have effected the way I do things in my life. As for what makes them different I would say that memory A shows how I crave a connection to my past and memory B shows how I try and refine my process in how I handle myself in the future.

When I was little I had a sled that was green and you sat inside it.  The sled had two black handles that you would pull to act as brakes.  i remember one time that I was using the sled and going really fast.  I pulled hard on the handles and I stopped so fast that the sled flipped over and I landed in the snow.  It was kind of shocking but funny when I remember it.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
These two are similar because they are both memories that happened in the past.  They both recall actions that I did.  They are different because one happened a long time ago.  They are also different because one is a cherished memory while the other is just what I did the day before.

Memory A:
I was driving to a venue to get ready to set up for a halloween party for the club I belong to. It is our annual fundraiser that we have, and was a murder mystery masquerade. It took me about 45 minutes to drive to the venue. Once there, we started setting up and decorating the hall. 


Memory B:
At convention in March I was nominated and voted in as district president of the club that I belong to. It was exciting and scary at the same time. I wasn't expecting it, and was very suprised that they thought I was the best candidate for the position. The convention was alot of fun and I spent alot of time talking to people and trying to come up with a game plan for the year. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are similar in that they were both events for the same club. The reason I was setting up for the halloween party is because of the events in memory B where I was elected as the district president.

Memory A:
my specific event that happen yesterday was when i went to visit my family it was kinda unexpected because i really didnt have no plans to go to see them but i wanted to because i was thinking about my family so much because we dont spend as much time together like we used to but it was something i wanted to do to wish them well but i had a great time being around them after so long

my most memorable moment was 2 years ago when i went grocery shopping i ran into a long-time friend that i havent seen since high school she was one of my only friends that i used to associate with she invited me to her birthday party as i arrive to her birthday party i help her get things together for her special moment we talk about a lot of i old highschool moments and how long we been knowing each other in always been good friends that never change it felt so unreal just to see her after so many years just to celebrate her birthday with her was fun in something i will always cherish


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
whats makes memory A and B similar is getting closer to my family after months of not seeing them. and running into my high school best friend in the grocery store i was glad to get a chance to get back closer to my family again and to see a good friend of mines we reunited after ao many years each moment was very special to me and its own way its something i will always think back on and just smile because each memory meant something special

Memory A:
I remember cutting my hair in the 4-6 PM gap yesterday.  I was upset because I didn't work much yesterday and when I came home, MTurk was dead as well.  I noticed that I was tired of the length of my hair at around 4:40 so I decided to cut it.  It was unplanned but I began to just completely clean my room and office area so I didn't actually start cutting until around 5:20.  I cut it then and took a shower. 


Memory B:
I remember the time I got my first skateboard.  I was really obese at the time but all I knew was that I wanted to ride one after watching all of the pros do it.  I was really excited and afraid that I was going to break it at the same time.  Of course I fell when I got on but it was a good feeling.  After about 30 minutes or so of having the wobbles, I felt that I was able to roll around a bit without being too nervous.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I felt happier and better about myself after I performed both of the actions.  When my hair is too long and my work space gets clustered, I get sad.  Fixing myself/my work area up made me feel accomplished just like riding the skateboard did.

Memory A:
The only thing that happened during that time was me being on mturk for that whole two hours. I worked on mturk taking various surveys and batches since it was [DAY OF THE WEEK]. I did have the tv on in the background while I did underpaying hits. I made around $15 an hour during those two hours.


Memory B:
I went to the store just before I started turking . I used money made on mturk to buy groceries and picked up some ice cream. I used around $100 for groceries. I rushed home and turned on the computer too start caching hits to do while I was putting the food away.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both are due to working on mturk.
