	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

									<p>
										The Honey Lab at Johns Hopkins University is looking for online participants for a psychology
										experiment. To be eligible for this experiment you must not have participated in any other experiments
										from the Honey Lab.
										Additionally, you must be at least 18 years old and be a fluent English speaker.
										The experiment will take approximately 15-25 minutes and will pay US$3.33.<br>
										Do not accept the HIT unless you can dedicate <b>continuous</b> time to the experiment.
									</p>
									<div class="alert alert-danger">
										<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong><br>
										If you have already completed this HIT or another similar HIT from the Honey Lab,
										the system will not allow you to run the HIT.
										If this looks familiar, please return the HIT so someone else can participate.
									</div>
									<p>	The experiment has been optimized for Firefox, Chrome, and Safari on desktops/laptops.<br>
										If you are using IE, Edge, or a mobile device, please change browsers and/or computers.
									</p>
									<p>	If the browser is restarted for any reason, you will not be able to complete the HIT.
									</p>
									<p>
										Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button above to begin the task.
									</p>

									If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"

									You should thus show them instructions to begin the

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
