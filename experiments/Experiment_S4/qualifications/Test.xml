    <Title>Qualification Test</Title>
    <Text>This test assesses if you have ever deeply followed various TV series. After taking this qualification test, you may be redirected away from our HIT. If this occurs, please search "Honey Lab Memory Experiment" to participate in our experiment. Please note that if you have taken some of our experiments before, you may be blocked from this HIT as we use some of the same questions. This will not prevent you from accepting unrelated HITs from us in the future.
