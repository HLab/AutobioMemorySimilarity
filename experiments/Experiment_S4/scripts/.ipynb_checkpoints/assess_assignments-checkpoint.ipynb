      "So, I remember a handful of events from the series...but I'll draw on one of my personal favorite episodes, for its absurd humor/suspense -- the one when Tuco Salamanca kidnapped Jessie Pinkman and Walter White, and took them to an undisclosed location far in the desert (I believe it may have been Tuco's uncle's house, whose name always escapes me, unfortunately...but, yeah -- the guy who had a stroke who's wheelchair-bound). Anyway, Jessie and Walter are going to try poisoning Tuco with ricin (potential ricin poisonings being a reoccurring trope on the show...'til Lydia finally gets hers, with her damn chamomile tea w/stevia). Walter and Jessie first try poisoning Tuco's tortilla, when he's turned around not looking at them busy cooking the tortillas -- but the uncle is the best sly character, totally notices and knows what they're up to, and tries warning Tuco with his signature \"ding-ding-ding!!\" doorbell/service bell he has installed on his wheelchair, and by acting weird. \"Me first, uncle!\" - Tuco says to the uncle when he's about to take a bite out of the poisoned taco (as I'm always saying \"Me first, kitties!\" to my cats when I want to eat before them, lol). The uncle subsequently makes a scene, I believe knocking the tortilla to the floor, so neither he nor Tuco end up poisoned. So, since THAT didn't work, Jessie and Walter then trying egging on Tuco to have a snort of some \"crystal blue persuasion\" with a pinch of ricin Walter brought with them, in the hopes of poisoning him that way. Too bad Jessie tells him there's some \"chili powder\" in it, to which Tuco subsequently tells him he \"hates chili powder!\" -- and decides against the imbibing. Meanwhile, Hank picked up on Tuco's trail out to this middle of nowhere location (why would he know Jessie and Walt are with him? Since he don't know nothin' yet); there's a shoot out with Tuco, leaving Hank wounded...yeah, I'm not remembering all of this so perfectly, actually! lol. Like, did Hank kill Tuco?! Actually don't a hundred percent remember...though I remember Walter and Jessie hiding, and a ditch in the dirt...and all very dramatic and suspenseful.

(to get either money or meth or both Jessie/Walter's hiding, don't 100% remember -- it was under the kitchen sink?) the moment Jane overdoses/chokes on her own vomit, and stands over her while it happens -- \"I watched Jane die,\" he later shockingly, mockingly admits to Jessie in their final moments together -- doing nothing to save her. When Jessie wakes up to her dead body the next morning, one of the first things he can't stop doing is listening to her voice on her recorded voicemail inbox message over and over and over and over again, he's in so much shock and pain. Mike is assigned by Saul to come \"clean it up\" -- make what happened, look like it didn't happen. Like so many events brilliantly interlinked on the show, Jane's death from heroin directly causes her father, distracted and beside himself with grief, to accidentally cause two planes in the air above Albuquerque to crash, causing the \"question\" of the singed, one-eyed pink teddy bear we see fall from the sky in the opening episode of the season, to finally come full circle and be \"answered.\"\n",
