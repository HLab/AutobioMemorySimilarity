Memory A:
This week, I researched ways to earn money either from home or with my car. Amazon's Mechanical Turk system intrigued me, and I spent a lot of time researching it. I decided that it seemed possible that I could earn a reasonable amount of money doing it with zero risk. It's been fun learning how the system works, and learning the tips and tricks to actually make it profitable. On top of that, the variety of tasks available have been quite engaging!


Memory B:
I remember my first motorsports event in 1995. It was an autocross that I competed in with my [CAR MODEL]. I was very nervous about it, and spent some time the night before driving ""brisk"" laps around a local bank parking lot in an effort to prepare. As it turns out, I was actually pretty good at it, and it has been my constant hobby for the past 25 years!


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both involve ways for me to keep busy, and both have proven to be enjoyable in different ways. Memory A is more as a means to earn money and make use of time while social distancing. Memory B was more a leisure activity.

Memory A:
I finished reading a book. This is memorable because quarantine brain has made concentrating very difficult. I read ""Emma"" by Jane Austen, for my monthly bookclub. Most of the time I read on my couch in-between working on MTurk. I remember feeling a sense of relief and accomplishment that I'd finished the damn thing.


Memory B:
Does this also have to be in the past week? I did a bakealong with an online friend. We made a gluten-free chocolate cake, with rice flour and potatoes. It was pretty fun.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are both activities I did because my state is still on lockdown so I was stuck in the house. They're both activities I normally find enjoyable but during these times are somewhat more difficult to enjoy.

Memory B:
I was taken on an exciting date by my boyfriend. He took me to the casino and gave me money to gamble. He gave me $200 to play with. We had a great night of gambling and drinking. I won $100.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are similar in that I was spending time with people I loved. I was able to enjoy memories with my favorite people. They were different in that one was in person the other was virtual.

In the last week I remember having to help my son age 6 make a project out of what would be garbage for earth day. He decided what he wanted to make and I helped him find ""trash"".  He came up with a good idea and I felt so proud of him.  I enjoyed our time together.


Memory B:
My memory is upsetting as hours have been reduced at my job.  The economy is very uncertain now and the trucking market is slowing.  The rates for working have significantly dropped and my company is losing revenue. This is upsetting as I may lose my job.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Everything about them is different.  One is happy and one is sad.  One is family and one is job.  One is a positive emotion and one is negative.

Memory A:
I went to Walmart to grocery shop. It's about 10 minute drive from my apartment. When I went there, there were so many people at the store. There weren't enough carts available so I had to wait for the next one. As a worker brought in a cart, another worker sprayed it down with disinfectant and then handed it to customers. I thought it was interesting.


Memory B:
I noticed my laptop was getting hotter and fans were spinning very fast. I opened up the bottom of the laptop and used compressed air to dust it out. As I was going to put it back together I thought to myself, 'Why don't I just leave it open if I'm not going to take it outside anyway?'. So I started using my laptop without the bottom part on.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are similar from the fact that they were experienced by myself only. There were no other person that played a large role in them. They are different in a lot of ways because the context of the memory is completely different. Memory A is about going grocery shopping and Memory B is about cleaning out laptop and making decisions.

Memory A:
I drove up to [US CITY] to visit my sister and her family this past weekend. It was my niece's birthday and I was invited for a small, family get together. I gifted my niece two silver coins and told her to save them for as long as she can. I had a lot of fun helping my sister bake a cake and lasagna. We all went on a hike and searched for pine cones and cool rocks.


Memory B:
A specific event in my life that I will never forget is the day I got my first car. It was a hot summer day in Southern California and I had finally saved up $3,000 to buy my neighbor's old car. I rushed home from my job at a bakery and paid my neighbor. After that, I drove to a local apartment complex where all my friends lived so I could show off my new ride. We all went swimming after that.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Memory A is similar to Memory B because I was spending time with loved ones. I am very close to my sister and her family and I am also very close with the friends I swam with in Memory B. Memory A is different than Memory B because it mostly involves quality time spent with family instead of material possessions.

Memory A:
This is not an over-the-top memory, but the first memory that came to mind was the delivery man coming in with my new mattress.  This was pretty exciting for me because without a mattress, I had been sleeping on the couch for several months.  What made this memory that much more intense was it took 21/2 weeks for the mattress to be delivered after I placed the order and paid for it.  The delivery time was of course extended due to the nation's pandemic.


Memory B:
The 2nd memory that popped into my mind was my graduation from Nursing school.  What an amazing day.  With all the hurdles along the way I had finally graduated and was set to begin a life long dream of being a Nurse.  My parents were so proud.  That day was all really good memories and I still smile when I think about it. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are same in the fact that both of the memories are happy ones.  They are different by Memory A being more recent than Memory B.

Memory A:
I connected with three old college friends on a Zoom call and chatted for a couple of hours. Though we occasionally text, my three friends and I rarely get to connect in any substantive way, having moved around the country and with all three of them now parents. We decided to have a Zoom call like many other people are now doing during the coronavirus pandemic. I thought it would be 30-40 minutes but we ended up talking and joking for 2 hours! They got to meet my boyfriend for the first time and I was able to see their husbands and babies. We ended the call happy and excited to do it again soon (maybe with a virtual board game to be played next time).


Memory B:
Around five and a half years ago, I came out to my mother and father. It had been a long time coming, but I was about to move in with my boyfriend and couldn't put it off any longer. We went out to dinner after they picked me up at the train station on a trip home to visit them. When we returned home from dinner, I told them I had to tell them something - that I'm seeing someone, and that it is a man. They were not totally surprised but it was a huge relief to have it out in the open and finally get over that hump, despite how terribly awkward it was in the moment. I remember my mother asking ""are you sure?"" but otherwise being quick to accept the situation.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
One was a highly emotional situation which was terrifying but ultimately liberating; Memory A was a more enjoyable moment that I will probably always remember but won't stick with the vividness of Memory B. That said, both memories involve letting people in to my life in a way that I hadn't before by introducing them to my boyfriend - my parents learned about him in Memory B, while my friends knew about him but got to actually speak with him in Memory A. Therefore, there was a sense of letting people know my authentic self in both memories.

Memory B:
my brother was going to participate in a raft race race on the [US RIVER] back in the 1980s or 70s. my father and mother and myself took a bus to go to the location on the river so that we could watch him participate. on the way, the buses brakes gave out and we we hit a car and went off the road.  luckily we were sitting in the escape row and we were able to open the door get out of the bus.  


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
they are definitely different why is an emergency situation that happened to me. The other is a disagreement with a family member.  however in a way I can see where you would say that they were both negative events.  also I have a vivid memory of the bus incident even though it happened long ago and the incident that happened recently about a disagreement will fade and time and I will not even remember it.

I had to walk across a farm and through a couple construction sites not in use, this was my shortcut. When I arrived the owner was kind and we talked for a bit before I got my order. The trip back was easier since by that point I knew I was going the right way.

I cooked a lobster for the first time ever. I wasnt sure what to do at first but once I found a big enough pot I figured id just boil it. I had to watch it constantly to make sure i wasnt over cooking it. In the end I managed to get it just right and it was delicious.

This was unconscionable and ridiculous and I realize that we will remain in this state of crisis because of donald trump.


Memory B:
I remember how concerned I am about this virus and how it is taking its toll on me and my family and I am sure others as well.

Some of the pictures made me really think about how long ago they were and how much my grandchildren have grown up since.


Memory B:
My second specific memory that stands out to me was when my daughter had her first child. We were all so nervous during this time and it brought me great job to know that I had become a grandmother. I really cherish the times I get to spend with my children and grandchildren.

I went for a ride on my bicycle this weekend. I chose a route that I hadn't done before but that could be done from my house without having to drive anywhere. The total distance was about 18 miles and it took me an hour and a half. The weather was perfect and the scenery was interesting. I am really glad I did it, but my legs are still sore from the ride.


Memory B:
I still remember vividly the day I proposed to my fiancee. I took her to a secluded spot that very few people knew about and we sat and talked for a while. It was raining by the time I wanted to ask her the question but I knew the time was right even if it meant getting wet. She said yes and cried tears of joy, and it was a wonderful moment.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories are similar in that they are of pleasant events. They both also evoke (for me, at least) images of the weather and surroundings of the time. The difference is that Memory A took place over a larger range of places since it involved travel, while Memory B took place mainly in one location. Memory B is also of a more significant event that I will likely think about more often in the future compared to Memory A.

As i continued walking a car passed by in a rush and hit the puddle which in turn created a wave and splashed me. I thought the moment was memorable because of how comical it was. I was soaked and kept walking home while thinking how unbelievable the day was.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories are different in context to one another. Where one memory has me experiencing a fun event in my life i n which i am sharing with a friend and the other memory is a slightly negative one. One memory has me going scuba diving and the other has me walking home and getting splashed on.

I took my little shih tzu with me and he sat on my lap while I drove. I loved watching his face in the rear view mirror as he dimmed his eyes to thoroughly enjoy the feeling of the breeze through his fur.

They let us hand feed them corn cobs and pet their beautiful, wide noses. It was one experience i will truly never forget.

Well, they're both memories that involve being outdoors and getting a bit of sunlight. They also involve animals and feeling a strong connection to them. I think they are both fairly similar situations, the specifics are really the only things that are different. Also In Memory A I was alone with my dog and in Memory A I was with my boyfriend and a few others sharing the moment.

Another event I remember is when my first nephew was born. He was born very early so it was unexpected. My dad drove our family 30 minutes to the hospital around 6am. We got to see him and he was so tiny.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Something that makes them similar is that they are both things that I had been waiting for. They are different because they occured almost 8 years apart from each other.

I can remember mowing the lawn last week. It was a warm, sunny day for late April. My arms were tired afterward from the weedwacker. It takes quite awhile, and I distinctly remember the podcasts I listened to while mowing and weedwacking. 


Memory B:
I remember the moment I popped my Achilles. It was just over a year ago. I still remember going to turn, hearing a pop, and then falling to the ground. I also distinctly remember a lack of pain, which is apparently quite uncommon. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They have very little in common. Memory A is rather pleasant, even if it involved physical labor. I guess that might be what they share, both were physical memories. Memory B is definitely a more negative memory despite the lack of pain. Also, it was much colder on that night in April in memory B.

Something that happened last week was that my wife and I went on a trip together. We drove through the country side and talked and shared things that had been bothering us for quite some time. Afterward, we camped out in the wilderness while overlooking a lake. It was a wonderful time and it gave my wife and I time to bond and cherish the moment we had.


Memory B:
My second memory is of that when I first met my wife. We were working on the same team at work and we didn't know each other at all. We both bounced ideas back and forth from each other, but we were also somewhat flirting. Afterwards, we went on a date and I was in awe. She was sweet, courteous and beautiful. We stayed at an amusement park most of the night just getting to know each other.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Yes, they both include my wife. Both memories are similar, because it is a time in which we both spent a day together. However, it is also somewhat dissimilar, because we kind of lost that connection in Memory B, but after that day we were back to how we used to be.

She later begged me that she was sorry to lied against me, but I don't think I can ever forgive her.

My most memorable experience When we got out of a driveway, our vehicle collided with an on coming van. My wife is sitting in the front passenger seat and my brother sits behind the car. As for my sister and my uncle was quietly sleeping behind me. My kids also play quietly in the car. I was afraid of the long journey I had to endure, still unconsciously sat down in the vehicle.

I've been doing a virtual trivia session online over the last few weeks, and last week was the biggest night ever. We had 26 teams and over 160 players. This has previously been going on in bars and restaurants, but with all of them closed due to the virus, it's had to be online. After it was over, the guy who supervised it got in touch and had a conversation about what things are going to look like when everything opens back up. It was good to start planning this out a bit, as I've been wondering what we were going to do with it after businesses start opening again.


Memory B:
I was dating a girl in college after having a crush on her a few years earlier while we were still in high school. She had been with another guy during high school but she broke up with him at some point. It turns out she had wanted to be with me all along. I found out the guy she was with was kind of an abusive stalker. After dating me for several months she abruptly cut things off - no contact - and went back to him. I never figured out why.

Memory B:
The second memory I remember is my middle school graduation. I felt incredibly sad as my middle school experience was great, and it was off to a new school, high school. I realized then that some of those people I would never see again, and how right I was. I felt an emptiness within me. To this day I feel nostalgic about that day. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
The one thing that makes both similar is that both contain a bit of nervousness from me. I felt nervous about both.

Memory B:
We had five cats, which was four too many.  I was coming home late one evening.  We live in a cul-de-sac, and I a cat was meowing incessantly coming across the street.  I thought it was my yellow cat.  So I opened the door and let him in.  It was a brand new kitten, about 4 months old.  So now we have six.  


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:

I have been self isolating with my girlfriend for the last few weeks, only going out twice to get groceries. I live several hours away and had to go back to my apartment to pick up mail and check on it. It had been the first time I had been back in over a month. As I was driving the roads were very empty, something that I had never seen before. The sun seemed brighter probably due to the changing seasons and me not being outside in a while. When going through my apartment, everything seemed so still and stale, everything seemed foreign to me. I quickly got my mail, checked to see if anything was broken or needed to be done and got out of there.


Memory B:
I drove to the supermarket to pick up groceries on saturday morning at 6 am. I almost never leave the house at this time and never go grocery shopping at this time but I wanted to avoid the crowds. The sun was just rising which was something I wasnt used to. The super market was earily quiet and there were very few people there. Everything felt fragile, like I had to be careful with my every move. I felt like I had to really efficient and move quickly while also being safe. I got through it and checked out but I remember walking out thinking how weird this all was.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both are experiences of going out after staying inside due to covid19. They both describe experiences that seemed foreign and felt like they were ""off"".   The only difference was that A was a longer memory that took place over several hours whereas B took place in like 20 minutes. I had more time to reflect on A  as it was happening. A didnt feel as strong as memory B.

She insisted she had said nothing wrong other than the truth. Her response only inflamed me further and I was not about to let it go. I called her out for her intransigence and walked away to cool down. I spoke with my girlfriend over the phone and she advised me to apologize to my mother and to not go to bed angry. I agreed and, after I hung up the phone, went to apologize to my mother for speaking harshly. I went to bed feeling relieved and better, because I don't like staying mad and holding grudges.


Memory B:
Over thirty years ago, in May 1989, I graduated from high school. The week that I graduated was the week that my favorite ice hockey team, the Calgary Flames, won the Stanley Cup. I have been a fan of the team since the mid-1980s, and their winning the Cup was the best graduation present I could have ever received. It was a bonus when a couple of my classmates called my house and congratulated me on the Flames winning the Cup. I even returned to my high school a week after the Flames' Cup win and collected on a bet from my economics teacher, who had asserted that Calgary wouldn't win the title. (I collected ten dollars.)


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Any similarities are: 1) both memories happened to myself; 2) both memories evoked strong feelings [anger, sadness, joy]; and 3) both memories still are fairly strong when recalling the experiences. Differences include: 1) Memory A brings up negative sensations/memories; Memory B recalls positive sensations/memories.

I was in my AP Literature class (1st period, so between 7:25 and 8:15am). I was on my phone, which I almost never did in class, as I'd finished the work for that class period. I logged into my account for that university to check my application status - and there was an additional tab under my account interface - ""Student."" I knew this meant I'd been accepted. I ended up spending seven years at that university for my BA and MA.

My mom and me travelled to another state that we live close to in order to go thrift shopping. The state had just relaxed some of their COVID-19 measures, so the thrift stores just opened. We left in the morning, and were done by noon, but we went to some grocery stores along the way. It was fun; we hadn't gone to that city in that state in years and years, so it was both nostalgic and refreshingly new, as we had never gone to that city's thrift stores in our whole lives. We got a few knick knacks for around the house, and I found a baseball glove for a left-handed thrower like myself. It was fun.

Another memory I have from the past week involves when I mowed the lawn as a kindness to my mother. We have two lawnmowers, so I accidentally grabbed the wrong one first, but switched before starting it. I did it kind of haphazardly; the mower was adjusted to be tall and so I had a hard time knowing where I had mowed previously, but after looking at it from the kitchen window it looked like a good job. My mom thanked me and was grateful. I felt good getting it out of the way.

I am thinking of the last time I saw the group of friends from the first memory, which was New Years Eve. Many of us met up in [US CITY] to attend a party and have a good time together. We went out for dinner, drank too much, and rung in a new year (and a new decade). That was the last large gathering I was at, pre-coronavirus, so it is fresh in my mind. 


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They are similar because they involve many of the same people. It involved catching up, laughing, and drinking with friends. The memories are different because one was last week and the other was 4 months ago. And memory A was not in person, it was virtual and used technology, and memory B was a face-to-face experience.

Memory A:
A memory from the recent week is when I meal prepped a few meals for the upcoming days. I had to start the rice in the rice maker, adding and measuring out the water carefully. Then, I browned onions and meat together with some spices to add some protein and flavor to the meals. Lastly, I had dry beans I made the night before by soaking for 24 hours, then cooking on low in the crock pot for about 16 hours. Once everything was done, I had to use a spoon and portion out everything in my to-go containers and then seal them up!


Memory B:
A few years ago, I spent the summer at my sister's house during my birthday. We were both a little short on spending money at the time, so my sister decided as a birthday treat we would go to different stores that had birthday promotions. We visited Rita's frozen treats and got a small frozen sorbet, then to Panera Bread, where we got a small pastry item, then we headed to Honey Baked Ham where we got a sandwich. After getting our goodies, we went back to her house and shared the treats. It was a fun memory and just a day to spend time together.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They both are experiences I went through, so that is probably the strongest similarity that I can think of. They both were somewhat self-serving too, in one I was making meals to provide nourishment and in the other, I was getting treats for my birthday. They are different experiences and situations so they are different. One took place recently where another one was a few years ago, so the time is different. I enjoyed both memories a lot though!

It was our final game to go to the Little League state finals and we needed to win this game.  I was pitching in the game and had gotten the bases loaded with know outs.

It's been going on for a while, but kind of slow to catch on in my neighborhood. This past week it really picked up and one night the howling was so loud, and you could hear it back and forth like people answering other's howls. It was really a fun thing to participate in.


Memory B:
I remember being at Walt Disney World with my grandparents and taking my grandpa to the first aid care center because he got a cut. My grandparents used to bring me to Disney world a lot when I was a kid, and this time I took them and wheeled them around in wheelchairs to experience it with them and my children. My grandpa's arm was bleeding so I took him to the first aid center at the Magic Kingdom and a very nice lady patched him up and gave him some Mickey stickers.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
They were both very different times, though both kind of show a camaradarie between me and someone else. In one case it's people I don't know, in Memory B it's someone I knew very well. Both were good memories and take me to a happy place.

I just recently graduated from university, but have been in a weird position since there is a pandemic going on. My older brother, who lives in a different city from me has been helping me out with trying to prepare myself to find work. Last week, we had a Google Hangout meeting where we discussed what kind of jobs I was interested in, what experiences he had, and how the pandemic may affect my prospects. He also spent time evaluating my resume and offered advice on how to improve it.


Memory B:
I remember when I was very young, possibly less than 5 years old, when I was still living in my family's old home. I was home alone with my mom at some random night. I recall that some group of people were outside my home, messing around and essentially harassing us. They were knocking on our doors and windows and making strange noises, and I remember being incredibly scared. I was so frightened that I puked all over our carpeted floor. I never knew exactly who was doing this, but I always assumed it was these teenage delinquents who lived down the street.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I didn't mention it specifically, but Memory A was done at home, which is similar to Memory B also being at home. They both involved family (brother in A, mother in B). I would say the tone of the memories are completely different, Memory A is recent memory about me discussing my future and how I can improve it while Memory B is a strictly horror story that took place in my far past.

There was an old man being wheeled around who looked like he was on the brink of death.

He wanted to get my ideas on what color to use for the wall since they are getting ready to repaint. I was surprised and asked him why he asked me, he said ""because you are an artist and you have good taste, that's why I thought you will do a good job helping me pick the color! You are in charge!""

I think it would be the time I graduated from my MBA program. It wasn't as smooth as I would imagined because some of the courses were really hard for me and I didn't really have much experience on them. However I tried my best to learn online for more case studies etc and I go to office hours to discuss my thoughts with my professors. I managed to get good grades so I was really happy with that. I didn't really attend the ceremony because for MBA it was really not that necessary and I don't live close to school, but I still felt so excited when I got my degree!


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
I think one thing makes them  similar is that they are both about ""ability"" of doing something. It is the ability I have and made progress with and then made me proud of myself.  I think the different part is that one is interest-related and one is academic-related, the school one is more like a solid step I made while the good taste is something I practiced in life, it is not that solid but I prefer to have it.

The memory I came up with is Mother's Day. Normally for the holiday we go out somewhere, but because of COVID-19 that didn't seem like a good idea. It ended up just being myself, my mom, and one of my uncles hanging out in a back yard, sitting on lawn chairs six feet apart and talking for a couple of hours. It was low-key and nice, kind of just a pleasant afternoon, but because of the occasion I'll remember it for a long time.

I remember when I got my first car. I was still in high school, and saved up enough money for a sports car that was significantly better than what most other people were driving. I didn't tell anyone, I just drove it to a party and parked outside, then when I left people noticed me getting in it. My friends surrounded it to the point I couldn't drive off until they'd all had a chance to look at it, sit in it, etc. I was kind of nice to be the center of attention for the evening.

Something memorable that happened last week was a work project that we had. This was a very important and high profile work project that had a tight deadline. The team was able to work together and help each other out to complete it to the clients satisfactions. I was proud of the team for supporting one another especially because we are all working from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project was very important and to put everything together so quickly and accurately showed how selfless our team was and made last week very memorable for me. 


Memory B:
A second memorable event happened with my family. We were playing board games as usual during our weekly family board game nights, but instead of getting into a heated discussion about who was winning we were able to talk it out. This was memorable because our family is usually very competitive and everyone disliked losing. This competitiveness resulted in situations where people may sometimes heated. To come together and discuss it peacefully was a great step and it showed that our family is growing and becoming closer. This step in our families growth was memorable and something that I'm very proud of.


How A and B are similar/dissimilar:
Both memories are similar in the fact that something positive and good happened. In Memory A, my team was successful in completing a project, while in Memory B, my family was able to put aside our competitive nature to discuss an issue. Differences between the two memories include where they take place. Memory A was a workplace issue, while Memory B was more personal and took place at home.
